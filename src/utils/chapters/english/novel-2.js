    subtitle: "Poonsolai Village",
    content: `The trade routes winding through the southern part of Sivaganga district, the lush green lands soaked with sediment, the shadows cast by neem trees swaying like the clear music of the southern breeze… all these together formed Poonsolai.

Even the scent of the wind was different here.
Not just the smell of earth… this was the fragrance of affection.
A scent that moistens the heart with roots, intimacies, and memories.

Poonsolai was indeed a small village. But its uniqueness lay in its greenery, in its ancient glory.
This village, which sprouts green even in summer, transforms into a flowery breeze with the cool southern wind in winter, enchanting human hearts.

There stood a large palatial mansion... the palace of the Venthanar family. When the growing rays of the sun fell as long shadows, that old red brick doorway slowly opened.

Seven feet high, this iron-bound plow door—this was not just a house... it was history itself.

About six and a half acres of land surrounded the palace, with corn and rice stalks swaying in the wind everywhere. Small boulders displaying courage around the front of the house, slanted lush plants on the upper side, rows of coconut trees... everything seemed less like a house and more like a forest.

The three-story wooden structure faced the main entrance. Red curtains danced in the swirling wind through the mid-level windows. Mature coconut trees were planted on both sides. The entire house was filled with architecture reminiscent of ancient cities and traditional sculptures.

From the side of that grand mansion, an ancient golden bell began to ring. That palace of Poonsolai, surrounded by greenery... light slowly began to illuminate the entire house. In the middle of the green garden, as the sun cast its golden light, a fragrant breeze swept from the eastern entrance of the palace.

The sacred prayer room inside the palace—though small, its serenity matched the divinity of a temple. In the center of that room, the daughter-in-law of the house, Mangai, sat with complete devotion in her eyes, lighting a lamp with garland for the sandalwood-adorned Goddess Meenakshi, singing:

"In the land of Madurai, she gained glory
Meenakshi mother, companion of my life!"

Listening to this in rapture, her father-in-law, mother-in-law, husband, and brother-in-law—all four sat in the reception hall.

After the prayer, Mangai showed the ritual lamp to the head of the house, Venthanar, with an auspiciously smiling face. With the subtle pride characteristic of palace dwellers and a raised forehead, he bowed to the lamp with calm dignity.

Next, Venthanar's wife Mangalammal, beside her their eldest son Sathiya Venthan (Mangai's husband), and second son Chandra Venthan touched and worshipped the lamp.

After showing the lamp to everyone, Mangai placed it in the prayer room and walked toward the kitchen to bring tea for everyone.

Before she returned, let us learn about the people in that palace!

The eldest head of the house:

Venthanar and his wife Mangalammal have two sons and one daughter.

Eldest son Sathiya Venthan and his wife Mangai have a son Nandavarman (29), daughter Pavithra (20)

Second son Chandra Venthan and his wife Vasanthi have a son Sarvesh (27), daughter Kavya (20)

Third daughter Prabavathi and her husband Deivavirakash have sons Pragatheesh (27) and Pranav (24). That's all for now—we'll learn about the others as the story unfolds!

Shortly, Mangai came with coffee for everyone, served it to the three of them, and turned to go back to the kitchen to attend to breakfast. She saw a figure standing at the doorway and froze in shock—the tray in Mangai's hands fell to the ground.

At the loud sound of the tray hitting the floor, the three sitting there turned around.

Mangai stood motionless, eyes wide, staring at the doorway. A look they had never seen before... not fear... but... shock! The three of them noticed where her gaze had fixed.

They too, who had been smiling... suddenly stood up.
At the doorway... as the morning sunlight shone, reflecting that light on his face, stood a man.

Seeing him... with such joy
"It's him! He is the eldest heir of this house!" they all stood there, forgetting themselves.

From the kitchen, Chandra Venthan's wife Vasanthi also came out, hearing the commotion in the reception hall.

At that moment, relatives from every room began to wake up and slowly came to the reception hall, seeing them staring at the doorway, everyone went there.

From the moment he stood at the doorway, the entire palace seemed to have frozen.

In that cool breeze mixed with greenery floated a new fragrance... and the taste of an old memory.

With joy sparkling in his eyes, Sathiya Venthan was the first to move. After eight years, seeing his son, he widened his eyes and opened his heart, touched his son's face with two fingers...

"Varma..." he called his son softly.

But he! He stood silent. However, he gave him one look. What did that man see in that look! Immediately, Sathiya Venthan rushed forward and embraced his son.

As his hand embraced his son, something that had been lacking for so many years was filled, his heart told him, but he couldn't understand what it was.

At the same time, standing a little behind him, a heart began to beat rapidly.

With trembling legs, Mangai came near her son. Tears prevented words from forming. She looked at her son's face... the face she had seen only in photographs for eight years. But now it stood alive before her. Was it real? That mother's heart beat rapidly as she gently touched his cheek with her finger and caressed it, saying "Varma... Varma... is this... a dream...?" Realizing he was standing there, both her hands grabbed him and broke into sobs.
Like an evening downpour, as if the tunnels of the mind had opened.

The melody of that cry echoed soundlessly throughout the palace.

Everyone else stood watching that scene.

In that crowd, only one person's gaze changed. Venthanar,
The eldest head of that house.

He didn't move... standing at a distance, he observed his grandson very intensely.

There was no anger on his face. But there was another kind of turmoil. His gaze seemed as if he was seeing everyone there as a stranger and noticing each person for the first time.

The sharpness in his gaze...
A fire at the corner of his eyes...
For a moment, his body trembled.

"This look... I've seen this before... is he really my grandson?" his mind began to draw many lines.

The others standing at the doorway
Chandra Venthan, Vasanthi, Sarvesh, Pavithra, Kavya, Prabavathi, Deivavirakash, Pragatheesh, Pranav—everyone stood together, wordless, merely as spectators.

Among them, only Sarvesh asked Pragatheesh in doubt, softly so only he could hear, "Is this our Varma?"

"Why are you asking like that?" said Pragatheesh.

"His face looks like our Varman... but something seems different about him..." he said.

"Just keep quiet for a while! You're babbling nonsense," he silenced him and began to observe what was happening.

As people came to him one by one to speak, without speaking a single word, he just stood there keenly observing all the faces and didn't say a word.

When everyone noticed that he remained silent like that, while everyone was in different mental states, Venthanar's voice rang out at that palace entrance to break the tension.

"How long are you going to keep him standing there? Bring him inside," he said.

Following his words, when Mangai gently said to bring Nandavarman inside, "Come in, Varma," she said with a smiling face.

At that moment... from behind Varman, a five-year-old girl's voice called out "Daddy."

That word... the sound of peace that had been flowing in that house shattered the next instant like a stone falling into water.

Mangai's face, which had been blooming with a smile, became empty in an instant.

Everyone's eyes there searched for who owned that voice. A girl child of about 5 years old slowly came from behind her father and stood near him with a smile,
"Daddy... should I come too?... with you," she asked, holding Varman's hand and coaxing.

"Okay, dear, let's go inside, come," Varman picked up his daughter with a small smile and entered inside that palace.

Everyone couldn't understand for a moment what was happening. The man who had listened to everyone in Varman's family talk all this time without speaking a single word, now entered with a smile as soon as that child spoke—everyone was shocked to see this.

Sathiya Venthan just stood there... not a word.

Varman didn't even say the words "She is my daughter." But the "Daddy..." that came from that child's mouth...
That was enough for everyone to understand who she was.

Everyone there stood at the doorway watching Varman go inside the house. The one who went inside turned toward them and told his father, "Father, tell Marudhu to bring all our luggage and keep it in my room," and left from there. But in the word "Father" that he called, everyone froze in that same place.

The head of that palace, Venthanar, watched the departing Varman and became even more confused.

At the same time, in the palace... at a distance, in a corner of that same Poonsolai, an old bicycle leaned against a rope-tied post. That place had hidden traces of emotions unknown to others. An old man sitting there laughed heartily and said, "This is just the beginning, Venthanar," and laughed.

This was not just a Poonsolai village... this was the beginning of a story. Not just a family's tradition, but the secrets of many generations were buried within its walls.

    subtitle: "Chapter 2",
    content: `Varman brought his daughter to the room, and for a moment his sharp eyes measured that room.
Yathra, who slowly looked around the room, asked her father questions with childlike wonder, and Varman patiently told her one by one.

That house was a new world for her. Even though she had been abroad for so many years, somehow she liked this house very much the moment she saw it. So she started looking at every place without missing a spot, holding her father's hand. When signs of sleepiness appeared in her eyes within a few minutes, her father, understanding this, gently patted her, and she leaned on his chest and fell asleep within seconds...Yathra...!

He gently laid her on the bed, gave an affectionate kiss on the child's forehead without disturbing her sleep. Taking his phone, he went to the balcony in that room.

Coming to the balcony, he took his phone and called someone.

When the phone was answered from the other side, Varman asked, "Did you inquire about the person I told you about or not?"

"I've sent all the details about them to your email. Check it. Not only that, the person you mentioned has booked tickets to come to India this coming Sunday," he said as additional information.

Hearing that news, as Nandavarman hung up the phone, a villainous smile bloomed on his face.

"I was also expecting you to come to India soon," he said in an angry voice.

After standing on that balcony for a while looking out at the garden, he realized it was getting late and entered the room again.

When Varman entered the room, seeing his daughter Yathra sleeping like an angel, he revealed a charming smile—only he knows what's in his mind.

While this was happening upstairs, downstairs... Varman's mother told her husband, "What sin did we commit, that our own son got married without even telling us," and cried.

Sathiya Venthan, unable to give any answer, hugged his wife and consoled her, thinking inwardly about how his son's appearance and speech had completely changed, while everyone in the family stood silently around them. Venthanar broke that silence.

"Why this crying! Whether you have faith in your son or not! But I have full faith in my heir. My grandson will never act in a way that brings shame to this grandfather. So stop crying,
After so many years, my grandson has come home. Arrange a feast that will astonish him
We can talk about everything else later..." he told his daughter-in-law.

"Sathya, Chandra... I need to talk to you a bit. Come with me." He took both his sons with him today.

As soon as the three entered the room, Venthanar looked directly at Sathya Venthan and asked, "Do you understand anything, Sathya?"

Without hesitation, Sathiya Venthan said, "Father... I have complete faith in my son.
He definitely wouldn't have done anything wrong. I firmly believe that!"

Hearing what his son said, Venthanar smiled gently, looked carefully at both his sons, and told them certain things that shocked both of them.

"Father... what are you saying?"
Chandra Venthan asked, stuttering.

"What I'm saying is true..."
he nodded slowly.

Hearing that, even his eldest son's eyes welled up a little. When he came to ask his father something, his father interrupted him, "For whatever reason...
Until my grandson tells the truth...
No one in this house should tell anyone about this!" he said and left that room.

As soon as he left the room, both happiness and worry appeared simultaneously on the faces of the brothers, and they hugged each other, expressed their joy, and left that room.

(When Nandavarman was eight years old, unexpectedly, the death of his twin brother Maravarman occurred by his own hand.

In that shock, Nandavarman remained unconscious for a week, and he had forgotten that such an event had even happened.

Though this was somewhat frightening for those in the house, the good thing about it was that he didn't ask about his brother Maran.

Thinking that if he stayed in this town, people here would tell him about it and make him sad, his family members admitted him to a hostel and arranged everything there, including school and college.

After finishing college, when he came to his hometown, everything went well for a few days. Then during an auspicious event at home, some people deliberately spoke about him being the killer of his brother and told him everything, deeply hurting his heart. When he asked his parents if all this was true and learned that everything was indeed true, his heart ached wounded. With guilt that he had killed his own twin brother by his own hand, despite the deceased trying to stop him, saying "I won't stay here," he left for abroad. Nandavarman was 22 years old when he left this town. After all these years, he has just now come to his hometown. Let's see what's in the mind of the one who has come!)

At the same time, Madurai city,
The city of Madurai, spread out as the heart of the south, stood upright carrying an ancient beauty that captivates the mind at first sight. Chariot streets passing through temple corridors, sunlight touching temple flagpoles, pure streets, temple bell sounds—all these were mixed together in the green corners of the city.

In one of the central areas of this city, a two-story house spread out neatly. The exterior shone like a white ground, with vines around the reception door, flower garlands, beautiful rangoli at the house entrance, and pillars with bouquets in the inner entrance—seeing all these, one could immediately know that there was a celebration in that house today. Yes, the engagement of the eldest heir of this house, our heroine, was being fixed today.

From beautiful sleep, eyes slowly opened, her pure complexion, her appearance filled with natural beauty—as Lord Surya entered that room with morning greetings, in that light our heroine Mitra Yazhini shone like a moon-drenched angel.

The heroine's family
Father Annadurai, mother Lakshmi, our heroine Mitra Yazhini, younger sister Thanuja, younger brother Roshan—these are the heroine's family members.

The heroine's father owns a large department store in the city. While mother Lakshmi takes care of the home, the heroine happily does her favorite profession of teaching. Mitra's younger sister is studying in her third year of college. Her younger brother is studying in his first year of college. Mitra's soul friend Durga works in Mitra's father's store. That's all—we can learn about the others as the story progresses.

Today she has her engagement, and in another week, her wedding, so she had taken a few days off from school and slept for a long time, our heroine.

Hearing the noise of relatives downstairs reaching her room, thinking it wouldn't be good to stay in her room any longer, she entered the bathroom and soon got ready to go down after bathing.

She braided her long hair luxuriously, and the white jasmine flowers adorning it added more beauty to her dark serpentine hair. With every movement, the gentle waves of jasmine announced her beauty.
With the wet glow of having just bathed, her crystal body became more polished, glittering like a diamond shining in sunlight. The beautiful shawl she wore showed off her slender waist even more prominently, revealing all her limbs like a sculpted statue. Her eyes like lotus petals sparkled with a magnetic gaze that could enchant anyone. The gentle smile on her rose petal-like lips added more polish to her complete beauty. As she slowly descended like a beauty statue, the wind, enchanted by her beauty, embraced and gently caressed her body. All eyes that saw her stood amazed, wondering if she was a goddess or an art painting. It must be said that everyone who saw the scene of her coming like a beauty goddess froze for a moment. While everyone stood entranced, an aunt of hers approached Mitra, warded off the evil eye, and said, "Only after the bride came down does this house feel like it has wedding festivities," making the place lively.

Another person held Mitra's hand and said, "I'm sad now that I don't have another face. If only I had another son, I would have asked him to snatch you away. You look so magnificent," and lovingly pinched her cheek.

Watching this, Thanuja's face, coming from her room, clearly showed envy. Still, hiding it, she said, "What are you saying? Won't you accept me as your daughter-in-law at all! Will you only ask to snatch away my sister?" and came to that place talking.

Hearing that, the woman said, "Girl, you don't suit my house. What will I do taking a chatterbox like you? Your sister is the one suitable for my family, modest and graceful," she replied outrageously to her question.

Hearing that, everyone there laughed loudly, and angry at her sister even for that, she moved away from that place. Otherwise, she would have to openly show her anger at her sister, she thought, and left from there.

Since the engagement was in the evening, relatives were coming one by one, and the reception hall was filled with family members and became lively within a few minutes. Mitra sat on the sofa with a smile, watching them all.

Then her father came near. He sat gently near her. Looking at her face silently for a moment, then
"Mitra... do you really... truly consent to this marriage, dear?" he asked gently.

Mitra, with a small smile
"Father... how many times will you ask... I fully consent to this marriage, Father," she said.

Her mother Lakshmi, who heard that conversation from a few steps away, came from the kitchen.

"Why do you keep asking her 'consent, consent' whenever you see her? Our daughter herself said she'll marry the boy we chose, so what doubt do you have after that?" she asked with some sternness.

Without answering his wife's question, to her husband sitting silently, "They forgot to buy banana leaves, you go and buy them," she sent her husband away and gave Mitra a smile before going to the kitchen.

Though everything was going smoothly, only Mitra's mind was not at peace. She knows how much affection her father has for her.
But for the past few days, it seemed to Mitra that along with affection in his gaze, there was also a kind of guilt. Though it was slightly irritating, she let it go without thinking more. Poor thing, if only she had thought more about that irritation then...
Would she have avoided hearing words that would hurt her later? Who knows? Fate spares no one.

    content: `Evening approached.
Every corner of that house had become lively. Some women took Mitra to the room and adorned her with joy-filled excitement.

At the same time, in the room where Thanuja stayed, along with her friends, she was applying makeup to herself to the point of drowning. Somehow, today she had to surpass Mitra and make herself registered in the viewers' eyes, and her friends were also helping her to do so.

At five o'clock in the evening, the gift amounts brought by the groom's family filled all the tables. Various fruit plates, gold bangles, silk sarees—each one proclaimed the wealth and prosperity of that family.

Groom Madhesh, his father Parantaman, mother Chintamani.

At the auspicious time, Mitra, called by the family, slowly descended from her upstairs room. While some women came forward to stand beside her, at that time Thanuja, saying she would stand beside her sister, stood beside Mitra showing off the painted face she had been applying all this time.

Seeing Mitra coming down, Parantaman, Chintamani, and all the relatives praised her beauty and said she was a perfect match for Madhesh. Seeing this, Madhesh's mother had such a smile on her face. Because wasn't she the girl she had seen? Yes, Mitra was the girl chosen by Madhesh's mother Chintamani.

Having seen and befriended Mitra every Tuesday at the Murugan temple weekly, she gradually talked to her husband to make her her daughter-in-law and now had arranged even the engagement.

The Mitra-Madhesh engagement papers were read.
"Their marriage will take place next Wednesday, that is, on the fifth, on Krishna Saptami," the priest confirmed, and the elders from both families exchanged ceremonial betel leaves.

Then Mitra and Madhesh—both exchanged rings with the blessings of the elders.

There was joy on the girl's face. But the groom, without even looking at the girl's face, reluctantly put on the ring.

Like him, Mitra's father Durai (Annadurai)...
Standing in a corner by the stage, was watching his daughter's figure motionlessly.

There was no joy on his face.
What appeared in his eyes was only emptiness... truths trapped in his mind that he couldn't escape. Unable to tell it to his daughter and unable to stay normal keeping it in his mind, he was struggling.

Whether anyone noticed both their faces or not! Mitra had been noticing.

When exchanging rings, just as every girl feels inside that she wants the groom to look at her with desire, Mitra felt the same and looked up at him. Seeing that he put on the ring reluctantly without even wanting to look at her face, she noticed, what to do? This is the time telling her through their actions that they don't like her. Though one mind said it seemed wrong, another mind said no, it won't be that wrong, it just seems that way to our mind, and a voice in her mind prevented her from thinking more about it. Like that, though one mind of Mitra said it seemed wrong, another mind confused her saying it wouldn't be like that and didn't let her think more.

Mitra-Madhesh engagement ended sweetly. In another week, the wedding.

After exchanging the engagement rings, Mitra's mother
"Thanuja... take the groom and sister to eat," she said.

Thanuja, with a smile on her face,
"Come, brother-in-law..." she said, held Madhesh's hand, and took him to the eating area. Mitra followed behind, watching Madhesh's hand joined with her sister's.

At the food serving area,
Thanuja asked both of them,
"What will you eat? Sambar or more kuzhambu?"
She asked each one and served them on the plate.

Watching from a distance, "Did you see, Samandhi? How responsible my younger daughter is," Mitra's mother praised Thanuja to Madhesh's mother.

Who knows what smoke there is in that praise?

At the same time, in Poonsolai village, when everyone sat at the eating place for dinner, Varman and his daughter Yathra alone hadn't come to serve food yet. Noting this, Venthanar told his granddaughter Pavithra and asked her to call them.

In Varman's room, father and daughter, who had just woken up well from journey fatigue, were cleaning themselves and coming down when they opened the door, Pavithra stood before them.

"Brother! Grandfather asked you and baby to come down to eat," she said only that and left from there without looking up at both their faces.

She was a little angry that "Brother got married without even telling anyone."

Carrying Yathra, the one who came down set his daughter down and made her sit beside him after sitting on the chair there. When he said no, she went to her grandmother.

Yathra went to her grandmother Mangai and asked,
"Grandma, what did you make for me to eat?" with interest.

As soon as she heard the word "Grandma" in that small voice,
Dew drops fell in Mangai's eyes.

With tears in her eyes and joy on her face, Mangai embraced and lifted her granddaughter. "My dear..." she said and kissed all over her face and pampered her.

Varman was watching that without any emotion. No one else can say what he's thinking in his mind except him.

Yathra spoke not only with Mangai but with everyone there, and not only that, she called them knowing what their relationship was—that was the wonder for everyone there.

When that child spoke with everyone, the sound of her laughter echoed throughout all places in that palace. It felt like life had come to that palace only now.

Sathiya Venthan, who had been watching his granddaughter's laughter all this time, "Come here to grandfather, dear," he called affectionately, lifted his granddaughter on his lap, and fed her food from his plate. Yathra also took the food her grandfather fed without any refusal.

While feeding her food, he asked his granddaughter, "How do you already know all of us, dear?"

"I've seen all of you in photos, grandfather. Daddy showed me all your photos and told me how to call you all..." she said.

Hearing that answer, Sathiya Venthan said,
"Never mind... when he got married, he forgot us. But he didn't forget us with you, he told you about us... that much is happiness..." the pain in his words was known to everyone there.

Again to his granddaughter
"Only you and your father came to the town... where is your mother, dear?" After he asked, only then did that question arise in the minds of others there too.

At that question, Yathra...
Looked at her father.
But thinking that they won't give him food if he notices what's happening there, or for some reason, he had taken food himself and was eating.

Seeing her father eating silently, Yathra thought, "How can you eat peacefully? How will I let you?" and gave an answer no one expected to the question Sathiya Venthan asked.

"Grandfather... Mother and Father had a very big fight... Father hit Mother... so Mother angrily left me and Father and went away," she said sadly.

Hearing those words from that child's mouth... the dining table became silent for a moment.

Not only that, Grandfather, "Mother treats me with great affection... but Mother won't let Father talk to me..." she said sadly.

(The child, not knowing fully about her mother, says this based only on what she saw. The child who has seen only one face of her mother and has immense affection for her—that affection will stir up what all... who knows?)

Hearing what Yathra said, Venthanar angrily asked, "What is this, Varma? What is your daughter saying?"

The one who had been silent all this time now stopped eating and answered his question with some coldness, "I need to talk to you alone."

Understanding why Varman was talking to him like this, grandfather also stopped eating, gave Varman one look, and went to his room from there.

But our hero, as if born only to eat, ate everything his mother cooked without missing anything, and then Varman went into his grandfather's room.

As soon as Varman went inside, the one who had been silent all this time, his younger brother Sarvesh, immediately approached his brother's daughter. "Hi, I am Sarvesh," he introduced himself, extending his hand to the child. The child looked at him up and down.

Seeing this, Pranav laughed and said, "Even that child somehow knows what you're like. It's looking at you strangely even though you extended your hand. Why do you bring shame to our family like this?" and laughed.

Looking at poor Yathra, the child said! "Why are you laughing? I didn't look at him wrongly. Should I call him uncle even though he's my uncle? Or should I call him chocolate boy?" she was wondering. You're looking at him and laughing, bad boy," Yathra scolded Pranav.

Hearing that, all the youngsters laughed. Sathiya Devan called Pavithra and asked her to take the child outside and feed her, sending all the youngsters away.

After everyone left, Mangai told her husband, "I'm scared seeing what our granddaughter says."

"Mangai, father went to talk, didn't he? He'll come and tell us. Until then, be calm," he subdued his wife.

After Varman went into his grandfather's room, an hour passed and neither of them came out. Those outside were watching anxiously, not knowing what was happening inside.

What would they talk about for a whole hour?

    subtitle: "Chapter 4",
    content: `More than an hour passed, and Varma was still talking with his father.

Sarvesh and Pranav were playing with that child there.

Truly, seeing that, for some unknown reason, Sathiya Devan couldn't stop thinking about his elder son Varma.

He was finding out just like a child.

So Mangai asked her husband, "Won't you ask our children?" Sarvesh told his mother, "Mother, don't ask that... Just the news that Varman brother has come, grandfather, who hasn't talked about anything for so long, has been talking with our brother for an hour now... so after the day brother left, today grandfather is doing well. If we ask grandfather in that good mental state, what will happen... so let's ask after grandfather and brother finish talking and come," he said.

The mother also understood that and became silent and left. The child, without knowing their talks, was running around... time was passing just watching that.

After that, more than two hours passed, and Varman was still talking with his father and coming out of that room.

After that, Varman, who came out, searched for "Where is Yathra?" for his child.

The child was playing with Pranav and Sarvesh... as soon as he came, the child ran toward him to hug him. Varman, carrying that child, turned to his father and said, "I'm leaving."

"Now? Stay a little longer, Varma. You came after so many days, it's difficult..." said Pranav's mother Pavithra.

To that, Varman said, "I have an important administrative meeting at the office tomorrow. I have to finish a file for that too. I need to finish that too. There's no other time. Otherwise, I would have taken a week off and come... that's why I have to leave now..." Varman gave an explanation.

"Okay, Varma... after going to office tomorrow, don't struggle too much... don't think there's no one in our house anymore. We're nearby..." they bid him farewell.

But all the other people had enmity or anger toward Varma, so none of them looked at Varman properly.

They didn't bid him farewell.

When Varman, carrying that child, was about to leave from here, Sarvesh stopped him. "Varma... forgive me, brother... please, what did that girl say... don't you know... you hit mother, bro? And also, I want to know what problem there was between you and your wife... that's why I'm asking... please don't take it angrily," he asked his brother honestly.

To his brother who asked like this, Varman said, "I'll tell you about that someday, Sarvesh. But now I have to go. Tomorrow morning I have to go to a very important meeting. That's why I'm leaving..." saying that, Varman was leaving.

At that time, Sarvesh asked his own brother, "Brother... you say you'll tell Sarvesh... is your son more important to you than us?" he asked.

"Ah... is he more important... right..." Varman replied sarcastically.

Seeing that, Sathiya Devan angrily said, "Varma, we raised you to keep you in the house and as a disciplined person. That's why, no matter what kind of person you are... but don't scold your wife... we won't even scold our sons-in-law normally. Even if our daughter got tainted... but what did you do to her, Varma..." he scolded angrily.

At that question, Varman looked at his daughter... that child was holding him tightly.

Since they were focused on scolding him, their gaze didn't go to the child at all.

That look was unbearable for Varman.

But like most men in the country, because he was male, the one who suppressed everything inside without becoming emotional remained silent.

Venthanar looked at Sathiya Devan and said, "Sathiya, okay, okay... don't get angry... Varma, go and come... come back..." and sent his grandson.

Varman also silently, carrying his daughter, walked away from there.

I followed my brother.

Seeing him suppress every emotion inside and go silently, my heart felt heavy.

He took the car. I stopped him again and called "Varma, two minutes."

Hearing that, he stopped there and looked at me.

I went there and said, "Brother, what is this like this? This child says in our house how we should raise children well, we raised them looking after. Hearing what this child says, what happened..." I asked.

Varman there said, "Father, I can't say anything. If you say something, I'm afraid I'll ruin our family in a situation I can't believe... that's why I'm saying," he says.

Hearing that, I said, "What happened then, Varma... did your wife really leave you?" I asked.

But to the question I asked, he replied, "What should I say... come and go." When he replied, I couldn't let it go.

    content: `That night, the entire Poonsolai village was calm. But only in the Venthanar family was there great commotion.

Sathiya Devan asked his father, "Father, I still don't understand. Why did Varma behave like this? What's the problem between him and his wife?"

Venthanar let out a deep sigh. "Sathiya, just knowing things from outside isn't enough. We have to know the truth inside before making a decision."

"But Father, did you hear what that girl said? Father hit mother. Isn't this very wrong?" Sarvesh interrupted.

"It's wrong, Sarvesh. But without knowing what happened before that, how can we pass judgment?" Venthanar replied.

Then Mangai came and said, "Should our granddaughter stay with us? The child will get proper care."

"That's Varma's decision. He has to decide," Venthanar said firmly.

The next morning, Varman attended a meeting at his office. But his mind wasn't there. His entire memory was revolving around yesterday's events.

When the meeting ended and he came to his room, his secretary brought a file. "Sir, documents related to this case."

Varman looked at that file. It was a divorce case. A storm hit his mind.

"Let someone else handle this. I don't want it," he said.

"But sir, it's been assigned to you. The senior partner said it's a very important case," the secretary explained.

Varman thought for a moment and said, "Okay, keep it. I'll look at it."

After she left, Varman put his head on his desk and sank into deep thought. His wife, his child, his family—everything was revolving in his mind.

Then his phone rang. It was his grandfather Venthanar.

"Varma, if you're free now, can you meet me once?" Venthanar asked.

"Grandfather, I still have some work. Can I come tomorrow?" Varman asked.

"Varma, this is very important. I need to talk about your wife and child. Please, come today itself," Venthanar insisted.

Varman thought for a moment. "Okay, Grandfather, I'll come at 6 PM," he said and put down the phone.

That evening, Varman went to his grandfather's house. Only Venthanar was in the house.

"Sit, Varma," Venthanar said.

Varman sat down. "What is it, Grandfather?"

"Varma, if I ask you, will you tell me the truth?" Venthanar asked.

"Grandfather..." Varman hesitated.

"Varma, I'm your grandfather. I'm asking for your good. Did your wife really leave you? What's the problem between you two?" Venthanar asked directly.

Varman bowed his head. Tears welled up in his eyes.

"Grandfather... I can't say," his voice trembled.

"Why, Varma? Don't you trust me?" Venthanar asked with affection.

"I trust you, Grandfather. But... I don't know what you'll think if I say this," Varman said.

"Varma, look at me," Venthanar held his shoulders and turned him toward himself. "You're my grandson. My blood. Whatever problem you have, I'll be on your side. Now tell me, what happened?"

Varman took a deep breath. "Grandfather... my wife... she..." he stopped.

"What, Varma? Speak," Venthanar encouraged.

"She deceived me, Grandfather," Varman finally said the truth.

Venthanar was shocked. "What are you saying, Varma?"

"Yes, Grandfather. She was with someone else... when I was busy at the office..." Varman struggled to breathe.

"Is that so? How do you know? Do you have evidence?" Venthanar asked.

"There is, Grandfather. I saw it with my own eyes," Varman said.

"Then what did you do?" Venthanar asked.

"I, in anger... her..." Varman stopped.

"Did you hit her?" Venthanar asked.

Varman nodded. "Yes, Grandfather. I made a mistake. But in that anger... I couldn't control myself."

"Then?" Venthanar asked.

"She left me. She left only Yathra with me and went. I don't even know where she is," Varman said.

Venthanar was silent. After a few moments, "Varma, do you truly believe there's fault in her?" he asked.

"I saw it with my own eyes, Grandfather," Varman said firmly.

    content: `Everyone in the Venthanar family had been tense since this morning. The truth Varman told his grandfather last night had shocked everyone.

Venthanar called his son Sathiya Devan as soon as he woke up in the morning. "Sathiya, today we all need to talk together."

"What's the matter, Father?" Sathiya Devan asked.

"About Varma. About his problem. Call everyone," Venthanar said.

Soon, the entire family gathered in the hall. Sathiya Devan, his wife Mangai, their sons Pranav and Sarvesh, Pavithra—everyone sat around Venthanar.

"Grandfather, what's the matter?" Pranav asked.

Venthanar looked at his family members. "Yesterday Varma told me everything. About his wife's matter."

"What did he say, Father?" Sathiya Devan asked eagerly.

"His wife deceived him. With someone else..." Venthanar began to say.

"What!" Mangai exclaimed in shock. "Is this true?"

"Varma said so. He saw it with his own eyes," Venthanar explained.

"That's why he hit her?" Sarvesh asked.

"Yes. He lost control in anger and hit her. That's why she left him," Venthanar said.

There was silence for a moment. Then Sathiya Devan began to speak. "Father, how do we know what's true in this? Varma says one thing. We don't know what his wife will say."

"That's what I thought too, Sathiya. That's why we need to find her too. We have to hear both sides before making a decision," Venthanar said.

"But where is she? Even Varma doesn't know," Mangai asked.

"That's why we need to find her. Sarvesh, Pranav, you two go and find out. Inquire at her parents' house, friends, everywhere," Venthanar ordered.

"Okay, Grandfather," both brothers said together.

"Father, should we tell Varma about all this?" Sathiya Devan asked.

"No. He's already under great stress. We can tell him after we find out," Venthanar said.

Then a small footstep sound was heard. Everyone turned and looked. There stood little Yathra, tears in her eyes.

"Yathra!" Mangai rushed and picked up the child. "Why are you crying, dear?"

"Grandma... I want mother. Where is mother?" the child asked.

Everyone's heart trembled. What answer to give to this small child?

Venthanar called that child near him. "Yathra, your mother will come in a few days. Until then, you stay with us, okay?"

"When will she come, Grandfather?" the child asked innocently.

"Soon, dear. If you're a good girl, your mother will come quickly," Venthanar said affectionately.

The child slowly nodded. But no one could hide the sadness in her eyes.

That evening, Pranav and Sarvesh went to Varman's wife's parents' house. There, Varman's father-in-law received them.

"Who are you?" he asked.

"Uncle, we're Varma's brothers. We came to see our sister-in-law," Sarvesh said.

The father-in-law's face hardened. "She's not here. I know what your brother did. Don't look for her."

"But uncle, we need to talk a bit. Please," Pranav pleaded.

"Go. Don't want here," the father-in-law tried to close the door.

Then a woman's voice was heard. "Father, who is it?"

That was Varman's wife's voice. Sarvesh spoke quickly. "Sister-in-law, we're Varma's brothers. We need to see you for a bit."

"I don't want to see anyone. Go," she said sternly.

"Sister-in-law, please. For Yathra's sake. For your child's sake," Pranav said.

"Is Yathra okay?" worry was evident in her voice.

"Yes, sister-in-law. But she misses you a lot. Please, can we talk for a bit?" Sarvesh asked.

A moment of silence. Then the door opened. There stood Varman's wife. Her eyes were red, her face had faded.

"What do you want to talk about?" she asked.

"Can we come inside?" Pranav asked.

She hesitated. Then nodded. They went inside.

"Sister-in-law, we came to find out the truth. Varma said you... him..." Sarvesh began.

"I deceived him?" she laughed. But it was a bitter laugh. "He'll think that. But the truth is different."

"What's the truth, sister-in-law?" Pranav asked.

She took a deep breath. "I'll tell you. But will you believe me?"

    subtitle: "The Weight of Truth",
    content: `Annadurai's heart was troubled. He sensed that his daughter's sharp gaze had pierced through him, and that she had understood everything just by looking at his face. "Should I tell her the truth now? Or should I keep hiding it, even though it will destroy the little happiness she has left?" The struggle raged in his mind.

Mitra noticed the pain in his eyes. Yet, with determination to know the truth today no matter what, she kept staring at her father.

Seeing his daughter looking at him with such resolve, Annadurai decided that he could no longer keep it hidden. 'Let whatever happens happen. Let all the suffering that must come, come today and be done with,' he thought. Just as he was about to open his mouth, "Mitra!" Lakshmi's voice called out as she came to that place.

Seeing Lakshmi coming quickly, Annadurai stopped what he was about to say and looked at his wife with anxiety.

There was a certain hardness in his eyes. Lakshmi threatened her husband with her eyes alone. She made a gesture to her husband that seemed to say, 'If you open your mouth, the consequences will be severe.'

Turning to Mitra, Lakshmi said with a smile covering her entire face, "Oh my! As the wedding approaches, my daughter's face keeps getting more beautiful! She's glowing like the moon, my daughter. I'm so happy just looking at her," she said in a coaxing voice.

Affection overflowed in her voice. But only Mitra's father knew that it was all an act.

Mitra heard her mother's affectionate words and smiled slightly. Her mind, which had been troubled and somewhat heavy with various thoughts until now, seemed to melt a little in her mother's love.

Lakshmi stroked Mitra's cheeks and asked, "What's wrong, Mitra? Why do you look like this?"

Just as she was starting to say "Nothing, Mother, it's about Mathesh—", Lakshmi stopped her from speaking.

"Are you asking about the groom Mathesh? The groom is golden, Mitra. He's perfect for your character and beauty. Even if we had searched ourselves, we wouldn't have found such a groom for you. He came looking for you on his own, didn't he? I'm very happy, Mitra. Just watch—after the wedding, everyone who comes will be amazed seeing you both together as a couple," Lakshmi said with some hidden meaning. But Mitra didn't understand it. She just sat listening to everything her mother said with a smile.

"Why are you sitting so quietly? The groom is very good, and that's why we're going to marry our daughter to him," she asked her husband.

He too forced a smile on his face and nodded his head as if saying yes.

"The groom's mother was saying that he doesn't talk much. Apparently, he doesn't talk much with anyone—seems to be very shy. Even during the engagement, she said the groom didn't talk to you and felt sorry about it," Lakshmi said, as if reading the doubt in Mitra's mind, speaking to enchant her.

Lakshmi's beautiful performance made Mitra forget the questions in her mind in a second.

"Mother and Father are happy about this wedding. Is Father sad because I'm getting married and leaving this house? Is that it?" she asked herself the question and answered it herself. 'Mother and everyone in the house are happy thinking about this wedding. I'm the one who's been confused thinking various things. He must just be shy like Mother said. Everything will be fine after the wedding,' she consoled her mind.

She completely forgot all the questions she had come to ask her father. She came to the decision that she could go ahead with her marriage for the family's happiness.

That's exactly what Lakshmi wanted. Annadurai looked at his wife and sighed deeply. The burden on his heart was heavier than before. If she had come a little late, his burden would have been lifted today.

While the three of them were talking, "Sister!" a voice was heard from the doorway.

At that voice, all three were startled and turned in the direction of the voice. There stood Valavan, Lakshmi's younger brother, a sturdy dark-complexioned man with a thick beard on his face, aged thirty-two.

As soon as they saw him, different emotions came and went on all three faces.

Mitra looked at Valavan with no expression, with an emotionless face. It was unclear whether her gaze reflected past events or was merely empty.

Her father Annadurai frowned in anger as soon as he saw Valavan. His eyes reddened, looking at him with a kind of disgust. Those eyes looked at him as if looking at a criminal.

But only Lakshmi's face bloomed with joy. Her eyes welling up, "Valava! Come inside," she called him in with affection.

Valavan clearly read the emotions that came and went on everyone's faces when they saw him. Mitra's emotionless gaze, Annadurai's anger, and his sister's affection created a kind of tension in Valavan's mind, and he entered the house with a somewhat tense face.

"Hey Valava! How are you? How many years has it been since I saw you!" Lakshmi grabbed his hands and asked with tears welling up in her eyes.

Hearing her words, Annadurai's patience ran out. "Enough! Stop it, Lakshmi!" he shouted angrily. "Is he coming back from working abroad? He went to jail for murder! And you're going to ask after his welfare? First, tell him to leave my house!" he shouted angrily.

Though his uncle's words hurt him, Valavan didn't show it on his face. The pain those words caused was buried deep in his mind, which his silence revealed.

"Why are you talking like this? He's my only brother! He came for our Mitra's wedding! And you're talking to him like this?" Lakshmi angrily looked at her husband.

"I don't care what you say—he shouldn't be in this house," said Turai.

"Are you trying to send my brother away? Then you won't see me alive after that!" Lakshmi didn't threaten her husband. But the determination visible in her eyes clearly conveyed the threat behind those words.

Annadurai understood that pressure and looked at his wife, startled. She threw him a look that could kill with her eyes alone, then took her brother Valavan and went inside.

Mitra watched them go without saying anything and quietly went back to her room.

But only Annadurai's eyes welled up watching the sister and brother. Because he knew the real reason why his wife had summoned Valavan. Even knowing that, the anguish of not being able to save his daughter from that danger was clearly visible in his eyes. But Mitra, who should have found out about it, wasn't there, so what could be done?

In Poonsolai village, when Venthanar said Samshika was "former daughter-in-law," shock spread across everyone's faces.

Those who were already shocked thinking "Is she even a woman?" were left speechless when they heard she was Varman's wife.

That woman's uncivilized appearance and arrogant speech made everyone frown.

Amid this commotion, Yathra, who had been sleeping on Pavithra's shoulder, slowly rubbed her eyes and looked up. When she saw her mother standing there, such a smile appeared on her face! Wasn't she seeing her mother after many days? Immediately, still in Pavithra's arms, "Mother!" she called out to Samshika with joy overflowing.

Samshika's thoughts—that grandfather knew all the truths about her and "How will they let me enter the house now?"—were shattered in a second by Yathra's voice.

Her mind thought at lightning speed. "Aha, this voice calling 'Mother'... I've found my way inside!"

She summoned a fake smile all over her face and, acting as if she had boundless affection for her daughter, "Yathra, darling! Were you here all this time?" she approached Yathra lovingly and took her from Pavithra's arms and hugged her.

Her eyes gleamed not so much with affection for Yathra, but with satisfaction at getting the opportunity to enter the palace.

As soon as Yathra saw her mother, she fell into her false web of affection. What does a child know? If anyone speaks to them affectionately, they'll trust them. Just like that, Yathra too, not knowing her mother's true nature or why she had come there, believed her sweet words.

"Yathra... how many days you've stayed away from Mother all alone... you have no love for me at all!" she said as if her eyes were welling up.

When mother cried, immediately Yathra also said, "Mother, I wanted to see you so badly, but Father wouldn't let me see you!" and the child cried too.

"From now on, Mother can't stay away from you even for a minute!" she shed fake tears while looking sideways at Venthanar.

He too was standing there smiling inwardly, watching the drama she was performing. He already knew that according to their plan, she would definitely enter the palace. So he stood there calmly without saying anything. But others were standing there anxiously thinking that if they let her into the house, their family would definitely not be well.

"Mother! From now on, I won't stay away from you either. Come, let's go inside the house! This is Father's house. Do you know how big this house is? You can stay here too. I'll talk to Grandfather and Father, Mother. Grandfather and Father will listen to what I say," said Yathra in childlike language.

"No, dear. Your father doesn't like me. So they won't let me inside the house," Samshika cried.

Everyone clearly understood that everything she was saying was an act.

"Mother! I'll talk to Father. Come, let's go! Grandfather, Mother will stay with me from now on. I can't be separated from Mother anymore. I told you yesterday, didn't I? Father beat Mother. That's why Mother got angry and left. But now Mother has come looking for us herself. I can't stay without Mother anymore. I'll only come inside the house if Mother is there!" cried Yathra.

Everyone looked at Venthanar, not knowing what to do.

He said without any expression, "Why are you crying now, Yathra dear? You just want your mother to stay in the house, that's all. Okay, I'll let your mother stay. Stop crying and go inside the house," said Venthanar.

Everyone was shocked at what he said and looked at him. He signaled everyone with his eyes to go inside the house.

They too went inside silently without saying anything for Yathra's sake, while Venthanar alone stood at that same place.

Yathra grabbed her mother's hand and took her inside the house. As Samshika entered the house, she looked back at Varman's grandfather, who stood outside watching her, with an arrogant glance and entered.

At the same time, Varman, who was talking with village elders in the temple, received a call: "Information about the girl you're looking for has been obtained." He immediately left to see his grandfather, not knowing that a curse had come and settled in the house.

    content: `While discussing arrangements for the temple festival that would take place in another two weeks with the village elders at the temple, his phone announced its presence.

He picked it up to see who it was—it was his friend calling. After informing those with him, he moved a little distance away to answer the phone. Whatever the person on the other end said made him immediately say he would leave for Madurai and hung up the phone. He told those there, "I need to leave town immediately. It will take at least three days for me to return. Until then, if there's anything important, talk to Grandfather," he said.

"What's this, brother? You just took responsibility today, and already you're saying you need to go to town?" asked someone.

"No, sir! There's an important matter I must go there for. I'm not going there just for personal reasons—it's for the good of our village too," he said.

Hearing him say that, they agreed to let him go without saying anything else.

As soon as they agreed, he took the car at whirlwind speed and went home.

As soon as the car stopped at the palace entrance, he quickly entered the house. As he entered the hall, everyone was sitting there silently.

Just seeing that silence, Varman realized something was wrong. As he approached his family members to inquire, from upstairs, "Daddy!" his beloved daughter Yathra called out and came running.

Seeing his daughter, Varman smiled and picked her up and kissed her on the cheek. "What is it? Is my princess very happy today?" he asked.

"Yes, Daddy! Your princess is very, very happy today. Tell me why—let's see if you know?"

"I don't know. Why is my princess so happy?" he coaxed his daughter.

"Oh, come on, Daddy! Why would I be so happy? I'll be happy when I see my Mommy!" she giggled.

When she said that, he looked up at his grandfather. He too gestured with his eyes as if saying "yes." Then, from upstairs, carrying grace in her walk and arrogance, Samshika descended.

On her face was a mixture of arrogance and a victorious smile. When she met Varman's gaze, for a second, she felt satisfaction thinking that he wouldn't have expected her here and that's why there was this shock on his face.

At the same time, as soon as Yathra saw her mother, she hugged her. Samshika too embraced her and smiled at Varman. That smile had many meanings buried in it. (Him seeing her suddenly at home today was a small shock, but he had expected her next week. Because he also knew that the ticket she had booked for Sunday had been canceled. As soon as he woke up in the morning, the first news he received was that Samshika had canceled her flight ticket. So he thought she wouldn't come this week but would come next week. But now seeing her suddenly at home, he was slightly taken aback—otherwise, he wasn't that shocked that she had come here. But he pretended to be shocked at seeing her.)

Varman, still not recovered from his shock, looked at his family members once. He too noticed the unwillingness on everyone's faces when they saw her.

After a moment, Varman broke the graveyard silence that prevailed there. His eyes remained fixed on Samshika. "You... how did you come here?" His voice mixed shock and anger. (Acting, nothing else, folks.)

Yathra held Samshika's hand and stood next to her.

Samshika smiled indifferently. "My daughter brought me inside. She seems to want me." "I too can't stay without our daughter, that's why I came here," she said.

Hearing what she said, Varman began grinding his teeth in anger.

With that same anger, he looked at his grandfather. He too slowly shook his head, conveying with his eyes alone that he had no choice but to admit Samshika inside because of Yathra.

Anger boiled inside him. Not wanting to make a scene in front of Yathra, he gritted his teeth and looked at Samshika. "What do you want?" his voice came down heavily with pressure.

Samshika casually shrugged her shoulders. "What do I want, you ask? I want my daughter. I'll also stay in this house with her," she said.

"Looking at his face itself is disgusting. For Grandfather's sake, I thought I could tolerate this much, but the more I look, the more revolting it is," he thought while standing there. Meanwhile, his daughter, not understanding the war being waged between her parents, was standing there holding her mother's hand with a blooming face, happy that her mother would now be staying with them.

"Daddy, from now on, Mommy will stay with us!" said Yathra.

Suddenly thinking of something, he immediately asked his daughter, "Yathra, you like Daddy, don't you?"

"Yes, Daddy! I like you very much!" said Yathra.

"Then okay! I agree that your Mommy can stay here for your sake. But your Mommy must stay in a separate room. She shouldn't cause problems with anyone in the house. If that's the case, your Mommy can stay in this house," said Varman.

But having already told Yathra that if he said this, and that if all three stayed in one room, they would be happy together forever without separation, the child believed what she said. So Yathra asked her father to let all three stay in one room.

"Look here, dear. Your Mommy and Daddy have separated. We can't be together anymore. So your Mommy must stay in a separate room," Venthanar said in a firm voice.

As soon as he said that her Mommy and Daddy had separated, Yathra pouted her lips, ready to cry.

Samshika went to pick up Yathra to console her. Before that, Sarvesh picked up the child. "Oh dear, what happened to our little darling? Why are you crying?" he asked affectionately.

"Chittu, Mommy shouldn't stay alone. I'll stay with Mommy too," Yathra said crying.

"Yathra, dear, don't cry. Why do you want to stay with Mommy?" Sarvesh tried to console her.

Before Yathra could answer, Samshika said, "My daughter doesn't need permission from any of you to stay with me," she said angrily.

At that, Varman glared at Samshika and said, "One more time you say 'my daughter' about my daughter, I'll kill you. You have no qualification to call her your daughter. She's my daughter. I'm the one who decides where she stays and who she should be with, not you," he said with fire sparking in his eyes.

"Yathra, your Mommy must stay in a separate room, or tell her to leave the house immediately," he said.

"No, Daddy! I'll stay with Mommy. I want Mommy!" Yathra told her father with tears.

"Yathra!" There was a harshness in Varman's voice that had never been there before.

"Varma, what's this? She's a small child—are you raising your voice at her?" Sathiya Venthan looked at his son angrily.

Not taking what he said to heart at all, "I'm going out of town for three days. During that time, she must stay in Pavithra Aunty's room. Until I come back, she must stay there. Or if I hear that you stayed with your Mommy, your Daddy will forget you," he said angrily.

Seeing the harshness in Varman's voice, Yathra, who had never seen this face of her father before, froze in shock.

This was the first time her Daddy had spoken so angrily. She stood there afraid to even look at her father's face in fear.

Samshika too didn't expect this harshness from Varman. She thought that no matter what happened, he would be calm for his daughter's sake, but seeing his face act completely differently, she looked at him suspiciously.

Having said everything, he left without even looking at his daughter's face, telling everyone in general that he was going out of town for three days, and went quickly to his room. Shortly after, he came with a suitcase in hand and gave only a nod to his grandfather and left from there. Within an hour and a half, the place he arrived at was Madurai Corporation.

    content: `As soon as Varman left the house, Venthanar told the servant there to show Samshika a room to stay in.

A servant there took Samshika's luggage and went ahead. She too approached to take Yathra from Sarvesh.

At that time, Varman's father signaled to his daughter with his eyes. Pavithra too came and stood in front of Sarvesh, shielding them both.

"Hey, idiot! Why are you standing in front of me?" Samshika asked somewhat irritably.

"Didn't you understand what my brother said? Or are you pretending not to understand?" said Pavithra without any fear on her face.

"I don't need to act for you. Move aside properly! I'm taking my daughter and going to my room," said Samshika.

Hearing that, Mangai said, "Listen here, ma! My son clearly said, didn't he? My granddaughter shouldn't stay in your room. So why are you making a problem?"

"Grandma! I'll stay with my Mommy. I can't stay without Mommy!" she told her grandmother.

At that question, little Yathra said to her father, holding on to Samshika's hand, "I'll stay with my Mommy!" and took her mother's hand and led her to the room assigned to Samshika.

A satisfied smile bloomed on Samshika's face seeing Yathra's action.

Everyone in the house looked at each other in shock.

Suddenly, Yathra's behavior seemed different to the others. She who had been standing quietly in fear after hearing Varman speak angrily, suddenly spoke and left as if under some spell—they watched in shock.

"This girl shouldn't have been allowed into our house at all. From the moment I saw her, my heart feels something is wrong," said Mangai.

"What's the use of lamenting now? Your son should have thought about all this when he married her. Now it's too late to worry about whether it's wrong or not. Leave it, Mangai. Whatever is meant to happen will happen," said her mother-in-law, and invited everyone to eat. Others too left from there without saying anything.

Only Venthanar sat at that same place, thinking deeply about something.

Here, having left home, within an hour Varman reached the hotel his friend had mentioned.

There, his friend Sarathi had been waiting for him alone in a private room for a long time. A young man aged 29. His dark complexion, long slightly disheveled hair, beard and mustache gave him a charming appearance. Sharp eyes, a gaze that always seemed to be analyzing something, showed he was a thinker. Though he had a slim build, the firmness in his shoulders showed he was strong. Though he wore ordinary jeans and a t-shirt, a deep intelligence was hidden within his simple appearance.

When Varman came to the room, he saw his friend sitting there. Sarathi too embraced Varman warmly as soon as he saw him. The one who had been everything to him since childhood, whom he had never been separated from even once. This was the first time he was separated from him. Having been separated from him, Sarathi got a little emotional and hugged him. That embrace contained the depth of many years of bonding and a kind of pain from unexpected separation.

Varman too smiled slightly and hugged him, making him sit in the chair next to him. Then the server who entered that room spread their food on the table and left. Shortly after finishing their breakfast, both sat on the sofa there.

"Okay, tell me. How much have you found out?" Varman got straight to the point.

"Varma, I've got information up to when they came to Madurai. After that, I haven't been able to get any news. Now we need to gather all the rest of the information," said Sarathi.

"We don't have much time, Sarathi. I have to go back to town in three days. When I go back to town, I have to go with her," said Varman.

"And another thing... what I didn't expect... this morning, Yathra's mother came to the house," he said calmly.

"What are you saying? This morning, news came to me that she had canceled her flight ticket. That's why I immediately called you and told you," said Sarathi in confusion.

"There's nothing to be confused about in this. Last night, news that Grandfather was going to hand over all responsibilities to me became known to her somehow. That's why she canceled the flight ticket she had booked and came here by her boyfriend's flight," said Varman.

"What are you saying? So David has come here too?" Sarathi asked in shock.

"He didn't come. Only she came. But he'll come here soon. Before he comes here, we somehow have to find my uncle. Only then can we foil her plan," said Varman with a kind of pressure.

"Don't you have even a small clue about where your uncle is?" Sarathi asked.

"No, da. I tried so much. Even last night, I got a small bit of information. When I went and looked there, someone else was there in his name," said Varman, conveying the failure of his attempts.

"Okay, leave all that problem. Now finding that girl is important," said Sarathi.

"Okay, tell your people to immediately collect information about everyone who came to Madurai on the date I mentioned," he said. After some more conversation, both of them left from there.

Three days passed in the blink of an eye. Only two more days remained until Mitra's wedding.

Wedding work was going on busily throughout the house. More than Mitra, the bride, her younger sister Thanuja was the one who was very busy with clothes, jewelry, facials, etc. Even though Durga called many times, Mitra refused to come to the parlor. Durga too didn't force her and let it go.

For the three days since Valavan came to the house, Mitra's father Annadurai had been secretly pleading with him without anyone knowing. But Valavan gave him no answer, giving only his silence as a reply. The desperation in Annadurai's eyes created no stir within Valavan.

Only the day before the wedding did Mitra's younger brother Roshan come home from the hostel. He liked Mitra much more than Thanuja. Ever since he learned that his beloved sister was getting married, he had been so happy. He had given invitations to all his college friends, insisting they come to the wedding, and had come home.

Tomorrow is the wedding. But Varman still hasn't been able to find the girl he was searching for. Having said he would return to town in three days, four days had passed. Perhaps thinking that if he let it go now, they would lose her without finding her, he kept wandering around without even taking a moment's rest. Every street, every piece of information gave him new hope. But all of them ended only in disappointment in the end.

At Mitra's house, everyone had left to go to the wedding hall since the wedding was tomorrow.

At the groom's house, since Mathesh and his father had invited only their close relatives, only key members were present at that hall from the groom's side. Even Mathesh's mother was consoled with various excuses about why they had invited only their close relatives to the wedding. For some reason, on Mathesh's face, which had no happiness at all on the engagement day, there was happiness now.

That day, there wasn't even the little bit of happiness that had been there on Mitra's face. The thoughts running through her mind were clearly visible on her face.

At the wedding hall, in the evening, all kinds of rituals, music programs, and dances ended in celebration.

Under the spectacular lighting, relatives chatted and laughed enthusiastically. Children and youth danced and enjoyed. Elders were consulting about rituals. While all this was happening on one side, Mathesh and Mitra sat in the midst of that commotion with a kind of detachment.

The noise of the night subsided, and dawn slowly broke. Through the large windows of the hall, the gentle light of dawn, mixed with the fragrance of flowers and the freshness of a new day, spread throughout the hall. Along with it, some murmurs.

"What's this! They called saying it's a wedding for the elder sister—here, the younger sister is getting married!" someone in the hall asked in shock.

"I knew it already! During the engagement itself, this groom was holding the younger sister's hand after putting the ring on the elder sister. I thought maybe it looked wrong to my cursed eyes. Only now do I know about their whole scheme. Poor girl—not only did the wedding not happen even after coming to the wedding stage, but he's tying the thali to her younger sister right in front of her. Will he be well at all?" lamented their neighbor lady.

"The younger sister liked the groom who was chosen for the elder sister, so they're marrying this girl off leaving that girl. Whatever they say, a raised daughter is a raised daughter, a born daughter is a born daughter—did you see?" said another person.

While people in the hall were saying various things, the girl—that is, Mitra—sat on the chair below the stage without any emotion, watching the two people on the stage who were smiling in fake happiness.

"Is there anger on her face?" If asked, definitely not.

But! She was lifeless even while alive.

    subtitle: "Revelations at Dawn",
    content: `4 AM in the bridal chamber. As a few voices could be heard in the wedding hall, our heroine Mitra, who had been sleeping, just woke up. Today was her wedding day. Her friend Durga woke Mitra up and told her to get ready for the wedding.

Mitra went to the bathroom, bathed, and came out. Her future mother-in-law entered the room with a beautician.

"This is my daughter-in-law. You need to get her ready, okay? There's plenty of time until the auspicious moment, so take your time and make her beautiful," she said and left the room.

The beautician seated Mitra and was beautifully displaying her makeup artistry when someone knocked hard on the door from outside. Durga went and opened the door.

Valavan stood there, showing no emotion on his face.

Seeing Valavan outside, Durga turned her face away and went inside.

Since childhood, Mitra, Durga, and Valavan had been close friends despite their age differences. Roshan wasn't with them as he grew up in a hostel. Thanuja never liked Valavan. The main reason for that was Valavan treated Mitra well.

At the age of 27, Valavan married a girl he loved.

Neither Mitra nor Durga liked that girl at all. Valavan married her despite their opposition.

No one knows what happened, but within a year of marriage, the police arrested him saying he had killed his wife.

It was shocking for both friends. They knew there definitely couldn't be any fault on their friend's part. Still, angry that he married her despite all their warnings, they hadn't spoken to him all these days. But after hearing this news, they couldn't stay without talking to him. So both of them went and met him.

The only words he said were "Please forgive me."

After that, he didn't speak a word and didn't meet anyone. After all these years, he came out of jail just four days before Mitra's wedding. When his sister went and met him in jail and said something, he immediately came out.

Since coming out, Mitra, Durga, and Valavan hadn't spoken a single word to each other. He too, thinking something in his mind, didn't speak to either of them.

"Mitra... I need to talk to you a bit," Valavan said in an emotionless voice.

When he said that, Mitra turned and looked at the beautician. The woman also said she would go have coffee and left the room.

As soon as the woman left, Valavan bolted the room door and approached Mitra. Grabbing her hand, "Leave this hall immediately. He's not the one for you. If you stay in this hall a little longer, seeing what happens next will break your heart," he said.

Hearing what he said, both Mitra and Durga looked at him in confusion.

"Uncle, what happened? Why are you talking like this? In a little while, I'm going to get married. Now you come and say, 'He's not the one for you.' How many days has it been since you came out of jail? Have you spoken a single word to me?" Mitra asked, starting angrily but ending with a broken voice, hurt that he hadn't spoken.

Valavan knew that too. He knew that if he didn't speak, Mitra would definitely be hurt. Even knowing that, there was only one reason he remained silent—for her to be safe until he handed her over to the one meant for her.

Now he didn't need to be silent. Because the one meant for her had come searching for her. This wedding would definitely happen today. Both of them would leave this Madurai land together and go to their ancestral place, his inner voice said. That's why he told her to leave the hall immediately.

"Whatever it is, explain it so we can understand. Don't speak in riddles like this—it's irritating me," Durga snapped a bit.

Looking back at her, Valavan clearly saw the anger she had toward him. Though it pained his heart to see it, thinking that wasn't important now, he began to tell Mitra what his sister had told him when she came to the jail.

"Valava, they came to see Mitra for a bride viewing. As soon as we saw that groom, we all liked him. So the groom's family immediately said let's fix the wedding, and we agreed. Four days before the engagement, Thanuja locked me and your father in a dark room with a knife in her hand. She threatened us saying 'I want only Mathesh, I won't marry anyone else.' We didn't know what to do. At that time, we agreed to what she said.

"As soon as we agreed, Thanuja told the groom about this matter, and the groom got a bit angry.

"That day she came crying and told us. We were happy thinking this problem was over. But the very next day, the groom called and said he agreed to marry our younger daughter.

"After Thanuja spoke with the groom, the friends who were with the groom changed the groom's mind by saying various things like Mitra isn't modern enough, dresses simply in saree, so she can't live abroad with him. We didn't know what to do."

"But! After Thanuja heard this, she insisted that if she married, she would only marry Mathesh. Because of my affection for Thanuja, I told your uncle, 'Let our daughter live the life she likes, we can find another groom for Mitra and get her married.' When he said it was absolutely impossible, in a fit of anger, I said, 'Mitra isn't our daughter, she's an orphan. But without caring for our biological daughter Thanuja's life, you're thinking about that orphan.'

"Hearing what I said, Thanuja learned all the truth too. After that, we couldn't control Thanuja at all. So we had to nod to everything she said. We convinced the groom's father about this matter using the groom. Only the groom's mother doesn't know."

Hearing everything she said, Valavan calmly looked at his sister and asked, "What's the connection between the story you're telling now and why you came to see me?"

"It's nothing, Valava? You've liked Mitra since childhood. She likes you too. Both of you always hang around together. We built hope in her saying she's getting married. Where will she find a groom at the last moment? That's why..." Lakshmi hesitated a bit to continue.

"That's why?" Valavan asked, grinding his teeth.

"That's why you marry our Mitra yourself, Valava," said Lakshmi.

Hearing that, his eyes filled with so much anger. If anyone else had talked to him about this at this time, he would have destroyed them right there without a trace. But it was his own sister asking, wasn't it? So he controlled his anger.

"Look here, Valava? I've also gotten the groom's father to agree to get you out. He said he'll hire a big lawyer and get you out. So you must agree to come out without saying anything else, okay?" said Lakshmi.

The one who had been listening and getting angry all this time made some other decision in his mind and said only, "I agree to come out."

He didn't say he would marry. But Lakshmi thought he had agreed to marry and happily took steps to get him out.

"This is what happened," he finished telling everything. Both women stood there frozen, speechless in shock.

Durga, more angry, without even considering that he was older than her in age, slapped Valavan hard.

Valavan was stunned by Durga's slap. Looking up, Durga was burning him with her eyes in anger.

"Where did your sense go when your sister told you? Don't you have any shame coming out of jail to marry? Pfft... are you even human?" Durga asked angrily.

"Durga, don't speak without understanding! I only said I'd come out. I didn't say I'm going to marry Mitra!" Valavan also got angry.

While both glared at each other, nearby Mitra's face showed so much sorrow. With that same sorrow, she left that room and went to where her mother and father were. There, her mother Lakshmi was laughing and talking among relatives.

As soon as she saw her, she went near her and called, "Mother..."

Lakshmi was startled at her voice and turned around. With the auspicious time set for 6 o'clock for her younger daughter, seeing her standing here now was a bit shocking. Still, without showing it outwardly, "What is it, Mitra? What are you doing here at this time? The bride shouldn't come outside like this," she said affectionately.

"Mother, if Thanu liked him, she could have told me directly, right? Why did you deceive me, Mother?" she asked with a broken voice.

Shocked by that, Lakshmi looked at Mitra's face. They had just applied makeup, but because she cried, her eyes were red and kajal smudged, looking pitiful. Though she didn't say what exactly, she understood—Mitra knew everything.

Telling the person next to her, "Wait a minute, I'll be back," she took Mitra a little distance away. "Don't make any problems, Mitra. Your sister's wedding is going to happen in a little while. Don't spoil the wedding by talking about all this at this time," she said.

While she was speaking, Mathesh's mother Chintamani came near them and glared at Lakshmi. "What kind of mother are you all? No mother would do such an act. If your younger daughter liked my son, you should have told Mitra directly or told me directly. Instead of that, you talked to my young son and my husband, confused their minds, and tried to conduct this wedding. What kind of people are you?" she shouted.

Everyone in the hall looked at them. Lakshmi, afraid that there would be a problem, "Samandhi Mother... speak softly please. Everyone is looking at us," she said.

"Let them look! Only then will everyone know your true nature. As a family, you deceived me. You even brought my son and husband into this. Don't you have any shame?" said Chintamani.

"Samandhi Mother, don't speak wrongly. Both children liked each other, so we thought of bringing them together," said Lakshmi.

"Don't you feel ashamed to say this?" While Chintamani kept shouting, her husband came to that place and tried to calm his wife down.

"You don't speak! How could you deceive this girl?" he asked sorrowfully.

"Mani, this isn't the time to talk about that. Look there, your son is sitting on the wedding platform. The wedding is in a little while. Are you going to make problems now?" he said.

"No matter what happens, Mitra is my daughter-in-law! No one can change that no matter what they think!" said Chintamani stubbornly.

When she said that, Lakshmi got angry. "Enough, Samandhi, stop! What fault did you find in the younger daughter?"

"What fault, you ask? Wanting to marry the groom chosen for her elder sister itself is shameful! Isn't that one reason enough?" said Chintamani.

    content: `When Mathesh's mother said that Mitra was her daughter-in-law no matter what, "Enough, Samandhi, stop! What fault did you find with my daughter?" Lakshmi asked angrily.

"What fault, you ask? Wanting to marry the groom chosen for her elder sister itself is shameful! Isn't that one reason enough to reject your younger daughter?" said Chintamani.

"Oh, is that so? So you're rejecting my daughter and trying to marry my son to this orphan who has no one?" said Lakshmi angrily.

At that, tears poured like a waterfall from Mitra's eyes, who had been watching them both with fear all this time.

Even Mathesh's mother Chintamani didn't expect these words at all. "Orphan? What does that mean...?" she thought and looked at Mitra, who was looking at her mother with tears in her eyes.

Lakshmi too, following her gaze and thinking that if she remained silent even after this, her daughter's life wouldn't go as desired, "Yes! She's standing right here. She's not our daughter. She's an orphan. Because she was an orphan with no one, we, being childless, thought of her as our daughter and raised her. Today, she's standing as an obstacle to my daughter's life. If I had known she would stand as such an obstacle, I wouldn't have agreed to raise her," she said without a bit of guilt.

Just then, Mitra's father, who came to that place hearing some commotion in the hall, heard his wife say the word "orphan."

As soon as he heard it, that man froze right there. What he hoped wouldn't happen was now happening there.

Lakshmi's fiery words thundered in Mitra's father's ears like lightning. The secret he had protected for all these years never thought it would break so blatantly. Just thinking of arranging the marriage between Mathesh and Thanuja made him feel guilty toward his eldest daughter. But he never expected his beloved daughter's birth secret itself would be revealed. He stood there like a statue. His legs refused to move as if stuck to the ground.

Mitra looked at her father. Seeing the shock and pain spread across his face broke her heart. His eyes welled up. How many times had he told Mitra, "You're the daughter dearer than my life."

But today, hearing the word "orphan" from her mother's mouth felt like it made all that affection a lie.

The commotion that happened there made everyone turn and look.

Durga and Valavan standing nearby froze in shock. Durga didn't expect this at all. But Valavan, who knew about his sister, thought something like this would definitely happen, but he never expected his sister to call her an orphan in front of so many people.

Durga boiled over. "What are you saying, Aunty? She's an orphan—what does that mean? If someone has no one, can you talk about them like this? Isn't this shameful for you?" Durga shouted furiously.

Following her, Valavan quickly went toward Lakshmi. His face showed so much anger. "Do you know what you're saying, Sister? After calling Mitra your daughter for all these years, you're hurting her with words like this today—don't you have any conscience at all?" Valavan's voice echoed through the hall. His eyes were red.

Chintamani stood there stunned.

Lakshmi was speechless, not knowing what to say. Only after Valavan shouted did she realize what she had done. She didn't speak intentionally—standing before her biological daughter's desire, nothing else was visible to her. So in a rush, she said everything, and only after saying it did she understand what she had said. Looking at her eldest daughter with some confusion, there was no expression on her face. Her mother's word "orphan" and her father's shocked pain told her everything about how true that orphan statement was.

The relatives gathered there watched what happened with disbelief and shock.

Pushing aside all her heartaches in a second, Mitra went near Mathesh's mother and said in a soft voice, "Please conduct this marriage between your son and my sister."

Seeing the determination in Mitra's eyes and noticing something on her son's face, Mathesh's mother agreed to the marriage without saying anything more after that.

Feeling sorry for what happened, she apologized to Mitra and stood aside in a corner.

As soon as she agreed to the marriage, Lakshmi, not thinking about anything else, with joy blooming on her face, immediately went to the wedding platform and hastened the wedding arrangements.

At the same time, Valavan pulled Mitra's hand aside and gave her a locket he had in his hand. "Your real mother had this in her hand when she died. At that age, not knowing what it was, I secretly took it from her hand without anyone knowing. But after reaching a certain age, I somehow kept it safe. Today I brought this in some memory. But I didn't think that after you learned all the truth, this would reach your hand, Mitra," he said.

Whether Mitra listened to what Valavan said or not, only she knew. As the time to tie the thali approached, showing no emotion on her face, she sat on the chair below the stage in bridal decoration, emotionless, watching the two people on stage with fake smiling faces.

"Is there anger on her face?" If asked, definitely not.

But! She was lifeless even while alive.

Just a while ago, those she had thought of as mother and father all these years called her an "orphan," and she collapsed at those words.

From the moment she heard the word orphan, there was no emotion on her face.

"In a little while, the moment the thali went up on her sister's neck, before leaving that hall without anyone knowing, she would have left thinking 'there's no one for me in this world, I'm an orphan.'"

Durga was angrily watching Mathesh tying the thali, so she didn't notice Mitra. But Valavan noticed. But without disturbing her, he followed her without her knowledge.

Though her mother noticed her leaving the hall, she didn't come to stop her. Thinking where would she go, she'd have to come home, she thought and went to perform the other rituals. But the one thing she never thought was that today would be the last day she'd see her.

Mitra's father had been sitting like one possessed since learning that his daughter knew all the truths.

Since Mitra's brother didn't know about the plan of mother, father, and Thanuja, thinking the auspicious time was seven o'clock, he went to call his friends. So he didn't know anything that happened in the hall.

Here, Mitra who left the hall, not even knowing where she was going, with eyes welling up, legs moved on their own. No clarity on where to go. In every step, a pain... in every breath, a cry. She didn't think of place, didn't think of direction... thought only one thing—the sudden emptiness.

On the road, the sound of moving vehicles, the screech of the wind... even with many people nearby, she felt her world was caught in darkness. Every step reminded her of the emptiness of her life.

At that time, she had no favorite place. That journey without answers to where to go, whom to seek... even while in so much pain, she didn't drop that locket in her hand. Somehow she held it thinking it shouldn't leave her. Now not just that locket, the owner of that locket also belonged only to her.

Then, due to excessive mental stress, as her head spun and she was about to fall down, a strong arm caught and held her.

The owner of that strong arm! Stood frozen looking at the lotus flower face in his hands.

Is this girl's body as soft as a temple flower?

Will it bruise if touched like a tender shoot?

As the breeze glides over the beautiful petals,

Did a thousand colors come together in her beauty!

A body like silk, a pleasure to behold,

Is she a rose petal touched by dew drops!

When walking, not even a burden to the earth,

Is she the total form of grace!

If her touch falls, the mind will swoon,

You temple flower with such softness!

"Won't this angel like a temple flower come into my life?" arose in the mind of that six-foot man.

Who could that six-foot man be?

    title: "Chapter 12",
    subtitle: "Destined Encounter",
    content: `Watching the two people seated on the wedding platform, Durga felt so much anger. Especially seeing Mathesh's smiling face made her so angry she wanted to kill him. With that same anger, "If you determine someone's life by just looking at their beauty, that life will never be good! This is just external appearance. The character inside is what guides a relationship to the end!" she said angrily and turned to her friend's side. Only then did she notice that both Mitra and Valavan were missing. With anxiety, she left that hall.

All this time, Mathesh's face which had been smiling, as if Durga's words wiped away all the smile. Noticing this, Thanuja spoke to him about various things and diverted his mind. She signaled to her mother, who also made arrangements to take the bride and groom home.

Mathesh's mother, who had been standing alone without participating in any activity there, not wanting to stand there anymore, left for home.

Here, Mitra walking wherever her feet took her, finally came and stood in front of that Shiva temple she always visited. The moment she was about to faint and fall, lacking strength in both body and mind, an iron arm caught and held her.

Looking at the girl lying like a wilted flower in his hand, "Won't this angel like a temple flower come into my life?" his mind murmured. Only after a few seconds did what his mind said reach his brain. Startled, he looked at the jasmine flower wilting in his hand.

Without his knowledge, his mind had leaned toward her. Immediately pushing away his unnecessary thoughts, he looked around. Were there others who came with this girl? Some people stood watching them curiously but didn't come close to them.

Glaring at them with his eyes, the moment he lifted the girl like a flower in his arms, suddenly the wind blew strongly, thunder rumbled, dark clouds gathered, and rain started early in the morning.

Immediately, without thinking about anything, he entered the nearby Shiva temple carrying her in his arms—Varman.

(Yes, the arms that caught and held Mitra were Varman's. The one who had been searching street by street for four days. Today, if he couldn't find his Bappu, he'd have to return to town again. In that situation, when he and Sarathi were having tea at a shop near that Shiva temple where Mitra was, seeing a woman with her back turned about to faint and fall, and a car coming from the other side, Varman dropped the tea in his hand and went at lightning speed to catch and hold her.)

Until then, Valavan, who stood aside watching everything that happened, had a slight smile on his face. That's what he thought, right! She went into the hands she was meant to join. Thinking his duty was done, Valavan felt relieved.

Yes, he knew who he was. Four months ago, when he first kept getting dreams of Varman holding Mitra, confused about what it meant, only then did he remember that locket. Immediately telling the guard there that he wanted to see his friend Nikhil, the guard was shocked.

Because he too knew that since coming to jail, he hadn't allowed anyone to visit. Only once did he meet his friends, after which he said he didn't want to meet anyone. But today, when he himself came saying he wanted to meet his friend, he was shocked.

Then he too informed Valavan's friend Nikhil of the news. Two days later, Nikhil had come to meet Valavan.

Valavan and Nikhil studied in the same college in different departments. Valavan studied Agriculture, and Nikhil studied to become a lawyer.

To his friend who came to see him, he spoke about the locket in his room and asked him to find out without anyone knowing whose it was, which town, everything. Nikhil also told Lakshmi that certain documents were needed to get Valavan out, took the locket from Valavan's room, and in a month collected all the information.

Telling Valavan everything he had collected, Valavan thought about something and said, "Don't tell anyone about this. In a few days, I'll come out myself," and sent him away.

When his sister came to call him 20 days ago, he first refused, but then thinking he should save Mitra from them and place her where she belonged, he came out of jail.

When leaving the hall, he came after Mitra thinking he should unite her with her family. But by then, she had already gone into the hands she was meant to be with.

After this, thinking whether he should stay here or not, Valavan stood there when Durga came near him anxiously.

"What? You're standing alone? Where's Mitra, uncle?" she asked with anxiety.

"Mitra is inside the temple," saying only that, he turned to leave from there.

"Saying she's inside the temple, where are you turning back to go? Come, let's go inside and see what she's doing. She shouldn't be alone now," without even asking what he was going to say, she dragged Valavan along.

Following them, the one who was anxiously wondering after his friend suddenly dropped the tea in his hand and ran.

Seeing him carry that girl in his arms and enter the temple in the blink of an eye, Sarathi was shocked.

Then, paying the shopkeeper for the tea they drank and the broken glass, he too went into that temple. Seeing the scene there, Sarathi froze.

His shock lasted only a few seconds. Immediately he quickly went near his friend.

"Hey! What are you doing?" he brought his friend back to his senses.

Until then, as if under some spell doing everything, he came to his senses only after his friend called him.

Still, without saying anything, he kept looking at "his own one! Without blinking" standing before him with tears in her eyes.

Somehow he couldn't bear to see her tears. So when he wiped her tears with his iron hand, not knowing why, her tears increased even more then.

Unable to watch that, he immediately pulled her and embraced her to his chest. Both their hearts felt as if they had found something they'd been searching for many days.

Seeing both of them standing embraced, Sarathi exclaimed "Oh no!"

"Hey! What are you doing? For four days, I wanted 'my Bappu,' saying I'll go to town with my Bappu, making me wander street by street without even letting me eat, and now what are you doing—tied the thali and standing embraced like this?" mentally washing his friend thoroughly, whether he heard it or not, Varman glared at his friend while keeping Mitra in his embrace.

Seeing him look, Sarathi softly asked, "Hey! Do you remember why you came here?"

Without answering what he asked, he took out the locket Mitra had from his pocket and gave it to him. Taking and looking at it, his face showed such happiness.

Looking at his friend's face with that same happiness, when he said 'yes' with his eyes, in joy Sarathi separated Mitra from him and embraced her. Mitra, in his embrace, blinked and turned back to look at Varman, her sudden husband burning in jealousy.

All this time, Durga, who had been watching what was happening while holding Valavan's hand, seeing Varman tie the thali to her and both of them hugging her friend, bit Valavan's hand and escaped from him, ran and came, separated Sarathi from Mitra and made him stand behind her.

"Hey! Who are you both?" she asked while glaring at both of them.

Before they could answer, Valavan who came to that place said, "They have more rights over her than us, Durga."

Varman looked at him puzzled. "I'm Mitra's friend," he said.

"Does tying the thali give them more rights than us?" Durga snapped at Valavan.

"I asked who you both are. How dare you tie the thali on her neck?" she looked angrily at Varman. Seeing that, Varman's rough lips smiled secretly and thought about what happened a while ago.

The one who carried the fainted girl into the temple, getting water from the priest there and sprinkling it on her face, in a short while her sculpted eyes slowly opened and looked at the one before her without blinking.

Then the priest asked, "How are you feeling now, ma?"

Looking at him, she nodded saying "Nothing," and he too moved away from that place.

Until then, Varman, who had been looking at her, only then saw the locket in her hand. His eyes startled and tried to take it from her hand.

She held it tightly and glared at him. Not minding that, "How did this come to you?" he asked with trembling.

The moment he first saw her, she had created turmoil in his mind. But when his 'Bappu' memory came, he immediately pushed aside his unnecessary thoughts and had carried her into the temple just to help her.

Now, seeing their family's ancestral locket in her hand, with many prayers in his mind hoping that his 'Bappu' he was searching for must be her, he looked at her to see what she would say. But before she could answer, the moon-like birthmark on her right hand itself showed who she was.

At that same time, when he asked, without her knowledge, "This is the only thing I have as my own. Those whom I thought were my family all these days aren't my family," she looked at his face with tears in her eyes. Before she could finish "I'm an orph..." he put his hand on her mouth and stopped her from speaking.

Taking the locket from her hand, "This locket isn't the only thing that's yours. From now on, this Varman also belongs only to you," he said.

Before she could think what, pulling her hand, he took her and tied the mangalsutra that was tied there for prayers around her neck.

That was when the three of them had entered the temple.

Thinking about that, his eyes unknowingly welled up slightly thinking of someone.

At that time, when Sarathi's phone rang and he answered, seeing the panic on his face, Varman asked, "What?"

With that same panicked face, "He escaped. He's gone to the palace," said Sarathi.
