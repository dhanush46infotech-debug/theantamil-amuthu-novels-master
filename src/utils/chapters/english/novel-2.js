    content: `The trade routes that wind through the southern part of Sivaganga district, the green lands soaked with sediment, the shadows cast by neem trees swaying like the clear music of the south wind... all these together formed Poonsolai.

Even the scent of the wind was different here.
Not just the smell of earth... this was the scent of affection.
A scent that moistens the heart with roots, intimacies, and memories.

Poonsolai was indeed a small village. But its uniqueness lies in its greenery, in its ancient glory.
This village, which sprouts green even in summer, transforms into a flowery breeze with the cool southern wind in winter, enchanting human hearts.

There stands a large palatial mansion... the palace of the Venthanar family. When the growing rays of the sun fell as long shadows, that old red brick doorway slowly opened.

Seven feet high, this is not a house with an iron-bound plow door... it is history.

About six and a half acres of land surround the palace, with corn and rice stalks swaying in the wind everywhere. Small rocks displaying courage around the front of the house, slanted lush plants on the upper side, rows of coconut trees... everything seemed less like a house and more like a forest.
