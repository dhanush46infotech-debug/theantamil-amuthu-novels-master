    subtitle: "Poonsolai Village",
    content: `The trade routes winding through the southern part of Sivaganga district, the lush green lands soaked with sediment, the shadows cast by neem trees swaying like the clear music of the southern breeze… all these together formed Poonsolai.

Even the scent of the wind was different here.
Not just the smell of earth… this was the fragrance of affection.
A scent that moistens the heart with roots, intimacies, and memories.

Poonsolai was indeed a small village. But its uniqueness lay in its greenery, in its ancient glory.
This village, which sprouts green even in summer, transforms into a flowery breeze with the cool southern wind in winter, enchanting human hearts.

There stood a large palatial mansion... the palace of the Venthanar family. When the growing rays of the sun fell as long shadows, that old red brick doorway slowly opened.

Seven feet high, this iron-bound plow door—this was not just a house... it was history itself.

About six and a half acres of land surrounded the palace, with corn and rice stalks swaying in the wind everywhere. Small boulders displaying courage around the front of the house, slanted lush plants on the upper side, rows of coconut trees... everything seemed less like a house and more like a forest.

The three-story wooden structure faced the main entrance. Red curtains danced in the swirling wind through the mid-level windows. Mature coconut trees were planted on both sides. The entire house was filled with architecture reminiscent of ancient cities and traditional sculptures.

From the side of that grand mansion, an ancient golden bell began to ring. That palace of Poonsolai, surrounded by greenery... light slowly began to illuminate the entire house. In the middle of the green garden, as the sun cast its golden light, a fragrant breeze swept from the eastern entrance of the palace.

The sacred prayer room inside the palace—though small, its serenity matched the divinity of a temple. In the center of that room, the daughter-in-law of the house, Mangai, sat with complete devotion in her eyes, lighting a lamp with garland for the sandalwood-adorned Goddess Meenakshi, singing:

"In the land of Madurai, she gained glory
Meenakshi mother, companion of my life!"

Listening to this in rapture, her father-in-law, mother-in-law, husband, and brother-in-law—all four sat in the reception hall.

After the prayer, Mangai showed the ritual lamp to the head of the house, Venthanar, with an auspiciously smiling face. With the subtle pride characteristic of palace dwellers and a raised forehead, he bowed to the lamp with calm dignity.

Next, Venthanar's wife Mangalammal, beside her their eldest son Sathiya Venthan (Mangai's husband), and second son Chandra Venthan touched and worshipped the lamp.

After showing the lamp to everyone, Mangai placed it in the prayer room and walked toward the kitchen to bring tea for everyone.

Before she returned, let us learn about the people in that palace!

The eldest head of the house:

Venthanar and his wife Mangalammal have two sons and one daughter.

Eldest son Sathiya Venthan and his wife Mangai have a son Nandavarman (29), daughter Pavithra (20)

Second son Chandra Venthan and his wife Vasanthi have a son Sarvesh (27), daughter Kavya (20)

Third daughter Prabavathi and her husband Deivavirakash have sons Pragatheesh (27) and Pranav (24). That's all for now—we'll learn about the others as the story unfolds!

Shortly, Mangai came with coffee for everyone, served it to the three of them, and turned to go back to the kitchen to attend to breakfast. She saw a figure standing at the doorway and froze in shock—the tray in Mangai's hands fell to the ground.

At the loud sound of the tray hitting the floor, the three sitting there turned around.

Mangai stood motionless, eyes wide, staring at the doorway. A look they had never seen before... not fear... but... shock! The three of them noticed where her gaze had fixed.

They too, who had been smiling... suddenly stood up.
At the doorway... as the morning sunlight shone, reflecting that light on his face, stood a man.

Seeing him... with such joy
"It's him! He is the eldest heir of this house!" they all stood there, forgetting themselves.

From the kitchen, Chandra Venthan's wife Vasanthi also came out, hearing the commotion in the reception hall.

At that moment, relatives from every room began to wake up and slowly came to the reception hall, seeing them staring at the doorway, everyone went there.

From the moment he stood at the doorway, the entire palace seemed to have frozen.

In that cool breeze mixed with greenery floated a new fragrance... and the taste of an old memory.

With joy sparkling in his eyes, Sathiya Venthan was the first to move. After eight years, seeing his son, he widened his eyes and opened his heart, touched his son's face with two fingers...

"Varma..." he called his son softly.

But he! He stood silent. However, he gave him one look. What did that man see in that look! Immediately, Sathiya Venthan rushed forward and embraced his son.

As his hand embraced his son, something that had been lacking for so many years was filled, his heart told him, but he couldn't understand what it was.

At the same time, standing a little behind him, a heart began to beat rapidly.

With trembling legs, Mangai came near her son. Tears prevented words from forming. She looked at her son's face... the face she had seen only in photographs for eight years. But now it stood alive before her. Was it real? That mother's heart beat rapidly as she gently touched his cheek with her finger and caressed it, saying "Varma... Varma... is this... a dream...?" Realizing he was standing there, both her hands grabbed him and broke into sobs.
Like an evening downpour, as if the tunnels of the mind had opened.

The melody of that cry echoed soundlessly throughout the palace.

Everyone else stood watching that scene.

In that crowd, only one person's gaze changed. Venthanar,
The eldest head of that house.

He didn't move... standing at a distance, he observed his grandson very intensely.

There was no anger on his face. But there was another kind of turmoil. His gaze seemed as if he was seeing everyone there as a stranger and noticing each person for the first time.

The sharpness in his gaze...
A fire at the corner of his eyes...
For a moment, his body trembled.

"This look... I've seen this before... is he really my grandson?" his mind began to draw many lines.

The others standing at the doorway
Chandra Venthan, Vasanthi, Sarvesh, Pavithra, Kavya, Prabavathi, Deivavirakash, Pragatheesh, Pranav—everyone stood together, wordless, merely as spectators.

Among them, only Sarvesh asked Pragatheesh in doubt, softly so only he could hear, "Is this our Varma?"

"Why are you asking like that?" said Pragatheesh.

"His face looks like our Varman... but something seems different about him..." he said.

"Just keep quiet for a while! You're babbling nonsense," he silenced him and began to observe what was happening.

As people came to him one by one to speak, without speaking a single word, he just stood there keenly observing all the faces and didn't say a word.

When everyone noticed that he remained silent like that, while everyone was in different mental states, Venthanar's voice rang out at that palace entrance to break the tension.

"How long are you going to keep him standing there? Bring him inside," he said.

Following his words, when Mangai gently said to bring Nandavarman inside, "Come in, Varma," she said with a smiling face.

At that moment... from behind Varman, a five-year-old girl's voice called out "Daddy."

That word... the sound of peace that had been flowing in that house shattered the next instant like a stone falling into water.

Mangai's face, which had been blooming with a smile, became empty in an instant.

Everyone's eyes there searched for who owned that voice. A girl child of about 5 years old slowly came from behind her father and stood near him with a smile,
"Daddy... should I come too?... with you," she asked, holding Varman's hand and coaxing.

"Okay, dear, let's go inside, come," Varman picked up his daughter with a small smile and entered inside that palace.

Everyone couldn't understand for a moment what was happening. The man who had listened to everyone in Varman's family talk all this time without speaking a single word, now entered with a smile as soon as that child spoke—everyone was shocked to see this.

Sathiya Venthan just stood there... not a word.

Varman didn't even say the words "She is my daughter." But the "Daddy..." that came from that child's mouth...
That was enough for everyone to understand who she was.

Everyone there stood at the doorway watching Varman go inside the house. The one who went inside turned toward them and told his father, "Father, tell Marudhu to bring all our luggage and keep it in my room," and left from there. But in the word "Father" that he called, everyone froze in that same place.

The head of that palace, Venthanar, watched the departing Varman and became even more confused.

At the same time, in the palace... at a distance, in a corner of that same Poonsolai, an old bicycle leaned against a rope-tied post. That place had hidden traces of emotions unknown to others. An old man sitting there laughed heartily and said, "This is just the beginning, Venthanar," and laughed.

This was not just a Poonsolai village... this was the beginning of a story. Not just a family's tradition, but the secrets of many generations were buried within its walls.

    subtitle: "Chapter 2",
    content: `Varman brought his daughter to the room, and for a moment his sharp eyes measured that room.
Yathra, who slowly looked around the room, asked her father questions with childlike wonder, and Varman patiently told her one by one.

That house was a new world for her. Even though she had been abroad for so many years, somehow she liked this house very much the moment she saw it. So she started looking at every place without missing a spot, holding her father's hand. When signs of sleepiness appeared in her eyes within a few minutes, her father, understanding this, gently patted her, and she leaned on his chest and fell asleep within seconds...Yathra...!

He gently laid her on the bed, gave an affectionate kiss on the child's forehead without disturbing her sleep. Taking his phone, he went to the balcony in that room.

Coming to the balcony, he took his phone and called someone.

When the phone was answered from the other side, Varman asked, "Did you inquire about the person I told you about or not?"

"I've sent all the details about them to your email. Check it. Not only that, the person you mentioned has booked tickets to come to India this coming Sunday," he said as additional information.

Hearing that news, as Nandavarman hung up the phone, a villainous smile bloomed on his face.

"I was also expecting you to come to India soon," he said in an angry voice.

After standing on that balcony for a while looking out at the garden, he realized it was getting late and entered the room again.

When Varman entered the room, seeing his daughter Yathra sleeping like an angel, he revealed a charming smile—only he knows what's in his mind.

While this was happening upstairs, downstairs... Varman's mother told her husband, "What sin did we commit, that our own son got married without even telling us," and cried.

Sathiya Venthan, unable to give any answer, hugged his wife and consoled her, thinking inwardly about how his son's appearance and speech had completely changed, while everyone in the family stood silently around them. Venthanar broke that silence.

"Why this crying! Whether you have faith in your son or not! But I have full faith in my heir. My grandson will never act in a way that brings shame to this grandfather. So stop crying,
After so many years, my grandson has come home. Arrange a feast that will astonish him
We can talk about everything else later..." he told his daughter-in-law.

"Sathya, Chandra... I need to talk to you a bit. Come with me." He took both his sons with him today.

As soon as the three entered the room, Venthanar looked directly at Sathya Venthan and asked, "Do you understand anything, Sathya?"

Without hesitation, Sathiya Venthan said, "Father... I have complete faith in my son.
He definitely wouldn't have done anything wrong. I firmly believe that!"

Hearing what his son said, Venthanar smiled gently, looked carefully at both his sons, and told them certain things that shocked both of them.

"Father... what are you saying?"
Chandra Venthan asked, stuttering.

"What I'm saying is true..."
he nodded slowly.

Hearing that, even his eldest son's eyes welled up a little. When he came to ask his father something, his father interrupted him, "For whatever reason...
Until my grandson tells the truth...
No one in this house should tell anyone about this!" he said and left that room.

As soon as he left the room, both happiness and worry appeared simultaneously on the faces of the brothers, and they hugged each other, expressed their joy, and left that room.

(When Nandavarman was eight years old, unexpectedly, the death of his twin brother Maravarman occurred by his own hand.

In that shock, Nandavarman remained unconscious for a week, and he had forgotten that such an event had even happened.

Though this was somewhat frightening for those in the house, the good thing about it was that he didn't ask about his brother Maran.

Thinking that if he stayed in this town, people here would tell him about it and make him sad, his family members admitted him to a hostel and arranged everything there, including school and college.

After finishing college, when he came to his hometown, everything went well for a few days. Then during an auspicious event at home, some people deliberately spoke about him being the killer of his brother and told him everything, deeply hurting his heart. When he asked his parents if all this was true and learned that everything was indeed true, his heart ached wounded. With guilt that he had killed his own twin brother by his own hand, despite the deceased trying to stop him, saying "I won't stay here," he left for abroad. Nandavarman was 22 years old when he left this town. After all these years, he has just now come to his hometown. Let's see what's in the mind of the one who has come!)

At the same time, Madurai city,
The city of Madurai, spread out as the heart of the south, stood upright carrying an ancient beauty that captivates the mind at first sight. Chariot streets passing through temple corridors, sunlight touching temple flagpoles, pure streets, temple bell sounds—all these were mixed together in the green corners of the city.

In one of the central areas of this city, a two-story house spread out neatly. The exterior shone like a white ground, with vines around the reception door, flower garlands, beautiful rangoli at the house entrance, and pillars with bouquets in the inner entrance—seeing all these, one could immediately know that there was a celebration in that house today. Yes, the engagement of the eldest heir of this house, our heroine, was being fixed today.

From beautiful sleep, eyes slowly opened, her pure complexion, her appearance filled with natural beauty—as Lord Surya entered that room with morning greetings, in that light our heroine Mitra Yazhini shone like a moon-drenched angel.

The heroine's family
Father Annadurai, mother Lakshmi, our heroine Mitra Yazhini, younger sister Thanuja, younger brother Roshan—these are the heroine's family members.

The heroine's father owns a large department store in the city. While mother Lakshmi takes care of the home, the heroine happily does her favorite profession of teaching. Mitra's younger sister is studying in her third year of college. Her younger brother is studying in his first year of college. Mitra's soul friend Durga works in Mitra's father's store. That's all—we can learn about the others as the story progresses.

Today she has her engagement, and in another week, her wedding, so she had taken a few days off from school and slept for a long time, our heroine.

Hearing the noise of relatives downstairs reaching her room, thinking it wouldn't be good to stay in her room any longer, she entered the bathroom and soon got ready to go down after bathing.

She braided her long hair luxuriously, and the white jasmine flowers adorning it added more beauty to her dark serpentine hair. With every movement, the gentle waves of jasmine announced her beauty.
With the wet glow of having just bathed, her crystal body became more polished, glittering like a diamond shining in sunlight. The beautiful shawl she wore showed off her slender waist even more prominently, revealing all her limbs like a sculpted statue. Her eyes like lotus petals sparkled with a magnetic gaze that could enchant anyone. The gentle smile on her rose petal-like lips added more polish to her complete beauty. As she slowly descended like a beauty statue, the wind, enchanted by her beauty, embraced and gently caressed her body. All eyes that saw her stood amazed, wondering if she was a goddess or an art painting. It must be said that everyone who saw the scene of her coming like a beauty goddess froze for a moment. While everyone stood entranced, an aunt of hers approached Mitra, warded off the evil eye, and said, "Only after the bride came down does this house feel like it has wedding festivities," making the place lively.

Another person held Mitra's hand and said, "I'm sad now that I don't have another face. If only I had another son, I would have asked him to snatch you away. You look so magnificent," and lovingly pinched her cheek.

Watching this, Thanuja's face, coming from her room, clearly showed envy. Still, hiding it, she said, "What are you saying? Won't you accept me as your daughter-in-law at all! Will you only ask to snatch away my sister?" and came to that place talking.

Hearing that, the woman said, "Girl, you don't suit my house. What will I do taking a chatterbox like you? Your sister is the one suitable for my family, modest and graceful," she replied outrageously to her question.

Hearing that, everyone there laughed loudly, and angry at her sister even for that, she moved away from that place. Otherwise, she would have to openly show her anger at her sister, she thought, and left from there.

Since the engagement was in the evening, relatives were coming one by one, and the reception hall was filled with family members and became lively within a few minutes. Mitra sat on the sofa with a smile, watching them all.

Then her father came near. He sat gently near her. Looking at her face silently for a moment, then
"Mitra... do you really... truly consent to this marriage, dear?" he asked gently.

Mitra, with a small smile
"Father... how many times will you ask... I fully consent to this marriage, Father," she said.

Her mother Lakshmi, who heard that conversation from a few steps away, came from the kitchen.

"Why do you keep asking her 'consent, consent' whenever you see her? Our daughter herself said she'll marry the boy we chose, so what doubt do you have after that?" she asked with some sternness.

Without answering his wife's question, to her husband sitting silently, "They forgot to buy banana leaves, you go and buy them," she sent her husband away and gave Mitra a smile before going to the kitchen.

Though everything was going smoothly, only Mitra's mind was not at peace. She knows how much affection her father has for her.
But for the past few days, it seemed to Mitra that along with affection in his gaze, there was also a kind of guilt. Though it was slightly irritating, she let it go without thinking more. Poor thing, if only she had thought more about that irritation then...
Would she have avoided hearing words that would hurt her later? Who knows? Fate spares no one.

    content: `Evening approached.
Every corner of that house had become lively. Some women took Mitra to the room and adorned her with joy-filled excitement.

At the same time, in the room where Thanuja stayed, along with her friends, she was applying makeup to herself to the point of drowning. Somehow, today she had to surpass Mitra and make herself registered in the viewers' eyes, and her friends were also helping her to do so.

At five o'clock in the evening, the gift amounts brought by the groom's family filled all the tables. Various fruit plates, gold bangles, silk sarees—each one proclaimed the wealth and prosperity of that family.

Groom Madhesh, his father Parantaman, mother Chintamani.

At the auspicious time, Mitra, called by the family, slowly descended from her upstairs room. While some women came forward to stand beside her, at that time Thanuja, saying she would stand beside her sister, stood beside Mitra showing off the painted face she had been applying all this time.

Seeing Mitra coming down, Parantaman, Chintamani, and all the relatives praised her beauty and said she was a perfect match for Madhesh. Seeing this, Madhesh's mother had such a smile on her face. Because wasn't she the girl she had seen? Yes, Mitra was the girl chosen by Madhesh's mother Chintamani.

Having seen and befriended Mitra every Tuesday at the Murugan temple weekly, she gradually talked to her husband to make her her daughter-in-law and now had arranged even the engagement.

The Mitra-Madhesh engagement papers were read.
"Their marriage will take place next Wednesday, that is, on the fifth, on Krishna Saptami," the priest confirmed, and the elders from both families exchanged ceremonial betel leaves.

Then Mitra and Madhesh—both exchanged rings with the blessings of the elders.

There was joy on the girl's face. But the groom, without even looking at the girl's face, reluctantly put on the ring.

Like him, Mitra's father Durai (Annadurai)...
Standing in a corner by the stage, was watching his daughter's figure motionlessly.

There was no joy on his face.
What appeared in his eyes was only emptiness... truths trapped in his mind that he couldn't escape. Unable to tell it to his daughter and unable to stay normal keeping it in his mind, he was struggling.

Whether anyone noticed both their faces or not! Mitra had been noticing.

When exchanging rings, just as every girl feels inside that she wants the groom to look at her with desire, Mitra felt the same and looked up at him. Seeing that he put on the ring reluctantly without even wanting to look at her face, she noticed, what to do? This is the time telling her through their actions that they don't like her. Though one mind said it seemed wrong, another mind said no, it won't be that wrong, it just seems that way to our mind, and a voice in her mind prevented her from thinking more about it. Like that, though one mind of Mitra said it seemed wrong, another mind confused her saying it wouldn't be like that and didn't let her think more.

Mitra-Madhesh engagement ended sweetly. In another week, the wedding.

After exchanging the engagement rings, Mitra's mother
"Thanuja... take the groom and sister to eat," she said.

Thanuja, with a smile on her face,
"Come, brother-in-law..." she said, held Madhesh's hand, and took him to the eating area. Mitra followed behind, watching Madhesh's hand joined with her sister's.

At the food serving area,
Thanuja asked both of them,
"What will you eat? Sambar or more kuzhambu?"
She asked each one and served them on the plate.

Watching from a distance, "Did you see, Samandhi? How responsible my younger daughter is," Mitra's mother praised Thanuja to Madhesh's mother.

Who knows what smoke there is in that praise?

At the same time, in Poonsolai village, when everyone sat at the eating place for dinner, Varman and his daughter Yathra alone hadn't come to serve food yet. Noting this, Venthanar told his granddaughter Pavithra and asked her to call them.

In Varman's room, father and daughter, who had just woken up well from journey fatigue, were cleaning themselves and coming down when they opened the door, Pavithra stood before them.

"Brother! Grandfather asked you and baby to come down to eat," she said only that and left from there without looking up at both their faces.

She was a little angry that "Brother got married without even telling anyone."

Carrying Yathra, the one who came down set his daughter down and made her sit beside him after sitting on the chair there. When he said no, she went to her grandmother.

Yathra went to her grandmother Mangai and asked,
"Grandma, what did you make for me to eat?" with interest.

As soon as she heard the word "Grandma" in that small voice,
Dew drops fell in Mangai's eyes.

With tears in her eyes and joy on her face, Mangai embraced and lifted her granddaughter. "My dear..." she said and kissed all over her face and pampered her.

Varman was watching that without any emotion. No one else can say what he's thinking in his mind except him.

Yathra spoke not only with Mangai but with everyone there, and not only that, she called them knowing what their relationship was—that was the wonder for everyone there.

When that child spoke with everyone, the sound of her laughter echoed throughout all places in that palace. It felt like life had come to that palace only now.

Sathiya Venthan, who had been watching his granddaughter's laughter all this time, "Come here to grandfather, dear," he called affectionately, lifted his granddaughter on his lap, and fed her food from his plate. Yathra also took the food her grandfather fed without any refusal.

While feeding her food, he asked his granddaughter, "How do you already know all of us, dear?"

"I've seen all of you in photos, grandfather. Daddy showed me all your photos and told me how to call you all..." she said.

Hearing that answer, Sathiya Venthan said,
"Never mind... when he got married, he forgot us. But he didn't forget us with you, he told you about us... that much is happiness..." the pain in his words was known to everyone there.

Again to his granddaughter
"Only you and your father came to the town... where is your mother, dear?" After he asked, only then did that question arise in the minds of others there too.

At that question, Yathra...
Looked at her father.
But thinking that they won't give him food if he notices what's happening there, or for some reason, he had taken food himself and was eating.

Seeing her father eating silently, Yathra thought, "How can you eat peacefully? How will I let you?" and gave an answer no one expected to the question Sathiya Venthan asked.

"Grandfather... Mother and Father had a very big fight... Father hit Mother... so Mother angrily left me and Father and went away," she said sadly.

Hearing those words from that child's mouth... the dining table became silent for a moment.

Not only that, Grandfather, "Mother treats me with great affection... but Mother won't let Father talk to me..." she said sadly.

(The child, not knowing fully about her mother, says this based only on what she saw. The child who has seen only one face of her mother and has immense affection for her—that affection will stir up what all... who knows?)

Hearing what Yathra said, Venthanar angrily asked, "What is this, Varma? What is your daughter saying?"

The one who had been silent all this time now stopped eating and answered his question with some coldness, "I need to talk to you alone."

Understanding why Varman was talking to him like this, grandfather also stopped eating, gave Varman one look, and went to his room from there.

But our hero, as if born only to eat, ate everything his mother cooked without missing anything, and then Varman went into his grandfather's room.

As soon as Varman went inside, the one who had been silent all this time, his younger brother Sarvesh, immediately approached his brother's daughter. "Hi, I am Sarvesh," he introduced himself, extending his hand to the child. The child looked at him up and down.

Seeing this, Pranav laughed and said, "Even that child somehow knows what you're like. It's looking at you strangely even though you extended your hand. Why do you bring shame to our family like this?" and laughed.

Looking at poor Yathra, the child said! "Why are you laughing? I didn't look at him wrongly. Should I call him uncle even though he's my uncle? Or should I call him chocolate boy?" she was wondering. You're looking at him and laughing, bad boy," Yathra scolded Pranav.

Hearing that, all the youngsters laughed. Sathiya Devan called Pavithra and asked her to take the child outside and feed her, sending all the youngsters away.

After everyone left, Mangai told her husband, "I'm scared seeing what our granddaughter says."

"Mangai, father went to talk, didn't he? He'll come and tell us. Until then, be calm," he subdued his wife.

After Varman went into his grandfather's room, an hour passed and neither of them came out. Those outside were watching anxiously, not knowing what was happening inside.

What would they talk about for a whole hour?

    subtitle: "Chapter 4",
    content: `More than an hour passed, and Varma was still talking with his father.

Sarvesh and Pranav were playing with that child there.

Truly, seeing that, for some unknown reason, Sathiya Devan couldn't stop thinking about his elder son Varma.

He was finding out just like a child.

So Mangai asked her husband, "Won't you ask our children?" Sarvesh told his mother, "Mother, don't ask that... Just the news that Varman brother has come, grandfather, who hasn't talked about anything for so long, has been talking with our brother for an hour now... so after the day brother left, today grandfather is doing well. If we ask grandfather in that good mental state, what will happen... so let's ask after grandfather and brother finish talking and come," he said.

The mother also understood that and became silent and left. The child, without knowing their talks, was running around... time was passing just watching that.

After that, more than two hours passed, and Varman was still talking with his father and coming out of that room.

After that, Varman, who came out, searched for "Where is Yathra?" for his child.

The child was playing with Pranav and Sarvesh... as soon as he came, the child ran toward him to hug him. Varman, carrying that child, turned to his father and said, "I'm leaving."

"Now? Stay a little longer, Varma. You came after so many days, it's difficult..." said Pranav's mother Pavithra.

To that, Varman said, "I have an important administrative meeting at the office tomorrow. I have to finish a file for that too. I need to finish that too. There's no other time. Otherwise, I would have taken a week off and come... that's why I have to leave now..." Varman gave an explanation.

"Okay, Varma... after going to office tomorrow, don't struggle too much... don't think there's no one in our house anymore. We're nearby..." they bid him farewell.

But all the other people had enmity or anger toward Varma, so none of them looked at Varman properly.

They didn't bid him farewell.

When Varman, carrying that child, was about to leave from here, Sarvesh stopped him. "Varma... forgive me, brother... please, what did that girl say... don't you know... you hit mother, bro? And also, I want to know what problem there was between you and your wife... that's why I'm asking... please don't take it angrily," he asked his brother honestly.

To his brother who asked like this, Varman said, "I'll tell you about that someday, Sarvesh. But now I have to go. Tomorrow morning I have to go to a very important meeting. That's why I'm leaving..." saying that, Varman was leaving.

At that time, Sarvesh asked his own brother, "Brother... you say you'll tell Sarvesh... is your son more important to you than us?" he asked.

"Ah... is he more important... right..." Varman replied sarcastically.

Seeing that, Sathiya Devan angrily said, "Varma, we raised you to keep you in the house and as a disciplined person. That's why, no matter what kind of person you are... but don't scold your wife... we won't even scold our sons-in-law normally. Even if our daughter got tainted... but what did you do to her, Varma..." he scolded angrily.

At that question, Varman looked at his daughter... that child was holding him tightly.

Since they were focused on scolding him, their gaze didn't go to the child at all.

That look was unbearable for Varman.

But like most men in the country, because he was male, the one who suppressed everything inside without becoming emotional remained silent.

Venthanar looked at Sathiya Devan and said, "Sathiya, okay, okay... don't get angry... Varma, go and come... come back..." and sent his grandson.

Varman also silently, carrying his daughter, walked away from there.

I followed my brother.

Seeing him suppress every emotion inside and go silently, my heart felt heavy.

He took the car. I stopped him again and called "Varma, two minutes."

Hearing that, he stopped there and looked at me.

I went there and said, "Brother, what is this like this? This child says in our house how we should raise children well, we raised them looking after. Hearing what this child says, what happened..." I asked.

Varman there said, "Father, I can't say anything. If you say something, I'm afraid I'll ruin our family in a situation I can't believe... that's why I'm saying," he says.

Hearing that, I said, "What happened then, Varma... did your wife really leave you?" I asked.

But to the question I asked, he replied, "What should I say... come and go." When he replied, I couldn't let it go.

    content: `That night, the entire Poonsolai village was calm. But only in the Venthanar family was there great commotion.

Sathiya Devan asked his father, "Father, I still don't understand. Why did Varma behave like this? What's the problem between him and his wife?"

Venthanar let out a deep sigh. "Sathiya, just knowing things from outside isn't enough. We have to know the truth inside before making a decision."

"But Father, did you hear what that girl said? Father hit mother. Isn't this very wrong?" Sarvesh interrupted.

"It's wrong, Sarvesh. But without knowing what happened before that, how can we pass judgment?" Venthanar replied.

Then Mangai came and said, "Should our granddaughter stay with us? The child will get proper care."

"That's Varma's decision. He has to decide," Venthanar said firmly.

The next morning, Varman attended a meeting at his office. But his mind wasn't there. His entire memory was revolving around yesterday's events.

When the meeting ended and he came to his room, his secretary brought a file. "Sir, documents related to this case."

Varman looked at that file. It was a divorce case. A storm hit his mind.

"Let someone else handle this. I don't want it," he said.

"But sir, it's been assigned to you. The senior partner said it's a very important case," the secretary explained.

Varman thought for a moment and said, "Okay, keep it. I'll look at it."

After she left, Varman put his head on his desk and sank into deep thought. His wife, his child, his family—everything was revolving in his mind.

Then his phone rang. It was his grandfather Venthanar.

"Varma, if you're free now, can you meet me once?" Venthanar asked.

"Grandfather, I still have some work. Can I come tomorrow?" Varman asked.

"Varma, this is very important. I need to talk about your wife and child. Please, come today itself," Venthanar insisted.

Varman thought for a moment. "Okay, Grandfather, I'll come at 6 PM," he said and put down the phone.

That evening, Varman went to his grandfather's house. Only Venthanar was in the house.

"Sit, Varma," Venthanar said.

Varman sat down. "What is it, Grandfather?"

"Varma, if I ask you, will you tell me the truth?" Venthanar asked.

"Grandfather..." Varman hesitated.

"Varma, I'm your grandfather. I'm asking for your good. Did your wife really leave you? What's the problem between you two?" Venthanar asked directly.

Varman bowed his head. Tears welled up in his eyes.

"Grandfather... I can't say," his voice trembled.

"Why, Varma? Don't you trust me?" Venthanar asked with affection.

"I trust you, Grandfather. But... I don't know what you'll think if I say this," Varman said.

"Varma, look at me," Venthanar held his shoulders and turned him toward himself. "You're my grandson. My blood. Whatever problem you have, I'll be on your side. Now tell me, what happened?"

Varman took a deep breath. "Grandfather... my wife... she..." he stopped.

"What, Varma? Speak," Venthanar encouraged.

"She deceived me, Grandfather," Varman finally said the truth.

Venthanar was shocked. "What are you saying, Varma?"

"Yes, Grandfather. She was with someone else... when I was busy at the office..." Varman struggled to breathe.

"Is that so? How do you know? Do you have evidence?" Venthanar asked.

"There is, Grandfather. I saw it with my own eyes," Varman said.

"Then what did you do?" Venthanar asked.

"I, in anger... her..." Varman stopped.

"Did you hit her?" Venthanar asked.

Varman nodded. "Yes, Grandfather. I made a mistake. But in that anger... I couldn't control myself."

"Then?" Venthanar asked.

"She left me. She left only Yathra with me and went. I don't even know where she is," Varman said.

Venthanar was silent. After a few moments, "Varma, do you truly believe there's fault in her?" he asked.

"I saw it with my own eyes, Grandfather," Varman said firmly.

    content: `Everyone in the Venthanar family had been tense since this morning. The truth Varman told his grandfather last night had shocked everyone.

Venthanar called his son Sathiya Devan as soon as he woke up in the morning. "Sathiya, today we all need to talk together."

"What's the matter, Father?" Sathiya Devan asked.

"About Varma. About his problem. Call everyone," Venthanar said.

Soon, the entire family gathered in the hall. Sathiya Devan, his wife Mangai, their sons Pranav and Sarvesh, Pavithra—everyone sat around Venthanar.

"Grandfather, what's the matter?" Pranav asked.

Venthanar looked at his family members. "Yesterday Varma told me everything. About his wife's matter."

"What did he say, Father?" Sathiya Devan asked eagerly.

"His wife deceived him. With someone else..." Venthanar began to say.

"What!" Mangai exclaimed in shock. "Is this true?"

"Varma said so. He saw it with his own eyes," Venthanar explained.

"That's why he hit her?" Sarvesh asked.

"Yes. He lost control in anger and hit her. That's why she left him," Venthanar said.

There was silence for a moment. Then Sathiya Devan began to speak. "Father, how do we know what's true in this? Varma says one thing. We don't know what his wife will say."

"That's what I thought too, Sathiya. That's why we need to find her too. We have to hear both sides before making a decision," Venthanar said.

"But where is she? Even Varma doesn't know," Mangai asked.

"That's why we need to find her. Sarvesh, Pranav, you two go and find out. Inquire at her parents' house, friends, everywhere," Venthanar ordered.

"Okay, Grandfather," both brothers said together.

"Father, should we tell Varma about all this?" Sathiya Devan asked.

"No. He's already under great stress. We can tell him after we find out," Venthanar said.

Then a small footstep sound was heard. Everyone turned and looked. There stood little Yathra, tears in her eyes.

"Yathra!" Mangai rushed and picked up the child. "Why are you crying, dear?"

"Grandma... I want mother. Where is mother?" the child asked.

Everyone's heart trembled. What answer to give to this small child?

Venthanar called that child near him. "Yathra, your mother will come in a few days. Until then, you stay with us, okay?"

"When will she come, Grandfather?" the child asked innocently.

"Soon, dear. If you're a good girl, your mother will come quickly," Venthanar said affectionately.

The child slowly nodded. But no one could hide the sadness in her eyes.

That evening, Pranav and Sarvesh went to Varman's wife's parents' house. There, Varman's father-in-law received them.

"Who are you?" he asked.

"Uncle, we're Varma's brothers. We came to see our sister-in-law," Sarvesh said.

The father-in-law's face hardened. "She's not here. I know what your brother did. Don't look for her."

"But uncle, we need to talk a bit. Please," Pranav pleaded.

"Go. Don't want here," the father-in-law tried to close the door.

Then a woman's voice was heard. "Father, who is it?"

That was Varman's wife's voice. Sarvesh spoke quickly. "Sister-in-law, we're Varma's brothers. We need to see you for a bit."

"I don't want to see anyone. Go," she said sternly.

"Sister-in-law, please. For Yathra's sake. For your child's sake," Pranav said.

"Is Yathra okay?" worry was evident in her voice.

"Yes, sister-in-law. But she misses you a lot. Please, can we talk for a bit?" Sarvesh asked.

A moment of silence. Then the door opened. There stood Varman's wife. Her eyes were red, her face had faded.

"What do you want to talk about?" she asked.

"Can we come inside?" Pranav asked.

She hesitated. Then nodded. They went inside.

"Sister-in-law, we came to find out the truth. Varma said you... him..." Sarvesh began.

"I deceived him?" she laughed. But it was a bitter laugh. "He'll think that. But the truth is different."

"What's the truth, sister-in-law?" Pranav asked.

She took a deep breath. "I'll tell you. But will you believe me?"
